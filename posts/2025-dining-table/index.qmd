# Introduction

In the 1990's, my family sold the cherry orchard in Weber County that had
belonged to my great grandfather Hubert Adams Macfarlane. My dad and his brother
collaborated to haul away and rough mill a fair amount of the wood from the
trees in that orchard. This wood sat in my parent's garage for about 30 years,
too valuable to discard but without a lot of attention paid to what might happen
to it. I took some at one point and made a butcher block cutting board for
my parents, and my uncle made a mantle for his fireplace, but that was about it.

A few years ago I was depressed for a number of reasons and started watching
woodworking videos on YouTube; I found the videos of people with saws and chisels and
routers and planes making beautiful things soothing.
I was interested in woodworking (cf. the butcher block) but lacked the skill or
tools or workshop to really get started on it, but the idea came to my mind to
eventually make a dining table out of grandpa Bert's wood. And if there was
enough wood, maybe a bench for the table as well.

# Table base
In Fall 2022 I had finalized my divorce and decided that this task would help me
get ready for whatever happened in my life next. I signed up to take a welding
class through UVU continuing adult education, and got access to the Provo High
School metals shop. The project I chose for this class was the base for my
dining table.

I invited Jenny Ostraff --- a good friend from high school --- to take the
welding class with me. I think we had a great time.

The design wasn't going to be terribly complex, but I hoped it would be modern
and distinctive. I dusted off my old drafting skills and downloaded Fusion 360
through my academic license. The design (shown in @fig-design) would be a solid
slab of wood supported by two trapezoidal steel frames welded at the corners.

On the pillars of these frames, I used the shop's plasma cutter to cut a pattern
into the steel (see @fig-pattern). Jenny is an artist and helped select and
transform a good one.  A little organic, but very modern. I am a professional
civil engineer and I took a class in structural steel design, which helped me 
know that I needed to potentially worry about how much material I was taking out
of the steel. At the same time, I know I'm not the right kind of engineer to
know enough about this to do it myself. I talked to my colleague Johnn Judd, 
who helped me determine that the critical buckling load of my table legs is about 
1200 lbs, which I think provides enough of a safety factor over even the most
robust feast.

I finished the table base in Spring 2023, and it spent the next couple of years in 
my parent's garage while I:  

  1. Moved into an apartment without a workspace or enough space for a dining table
  1. Got married to Jenny
  1. Bought a house with a garage and a dining area

Once we had the house, I took the bases to a local metal fabricator who
powdercoated it. I was pretty happy with how it all turned out, as seen in @fig-coated.

# Table Top

Having purchased a house that Jenny and I intend to stay in for a while, we had the 
necessary space and parameters to finish our table.
I worked with my good friend Ben Ward at the BYU carpentry shop to mill the rough
boards into something that would be more suitable to work with.

![Milling the boards.](https://imgur.com/bhTLuhw){#fig-milling}

But I didn't want the table to be my first serious project, given the 
sentimental (and financial) value of the wood I was going to use. But
I needed open shelving for my newly remodeled kitchen, and so I bought 
a bit of cherry wood to give me a warmup.

Doing this little shelving project was actually useful, because the leftover
wood from that project is exactly what I needed to finish the layout for the table
with dimensions that would work for our space. I joined the boards with 
glue and biscuits into two separate pieces, and then went back to BYU and
had Ben help me plane the two pieces into something smooth and nice.
The final glue up required a small amount of extra clamping to compensate for bends in 
the boards (see the back of @fig-fig-glueup).

Gluing the table.

I mounted the table to the base with 1/4 20 carriage bolts, using holes I had
drilled into the tops of the bases and threaded brass inserts embedded
underneath the table. The bottom of the bases uses leveling feet secured with 
nuts and finished with acorn nuts. I finished the surface with three coats of
oil-based polyurethane to really make the grain of the heritage cherry wood
shine.

## Wobble

I noticed some vibration in the steel frames as I moved them around the shop,
but figured the weight of the table would dampen the vibration. Instead,
it turned the table into a pendulum: bumping the top would cause the whole table
to shake for several seconds. So I went back to Johnn to talk about how I didn't
understand structural vibrations either. He gave me some ideas, and
I decided to use high-strength tensioning cable and turnbuckles to cross-brace
the frame. I was prepared to do a full $X$-shape, but one diagonal in each 
frame seems to sufficiently increase the stiffness. Orienting them in the same
direction keeps rotational forces from starting vibrations as well. 

![Cross-bracing](https://imgur.com/NwJK8BI){#fig-bracing}

The cable makes it hard to store chairs at the heads of the table, and
it interferes modestly with the person sitting there, but it's not terrible.
And it's better than wobbling.

# Conclusion

![Installed in the kitchen.](https://imgur.com/gkOpdmq){#fig-final}

I think it looks good. The bench means we can seat either two adults or a battery of nieces.

It was fun to do this project with Jenny who started her involvement as a friend
I was talking to about this wild idea I had, and who has seen it to completion as the
partner who is thrilled to have it in her dining room forever.
