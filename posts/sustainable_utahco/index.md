Last week the Deseret News ran a contributed [opinion piece by Andrew Skabelund](https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2020/8/10/21358753/guest-opinion-utah-county-tech-centric-future-human-natural-resources-silicon-slopes-farming-desert)[^index-1] in which he argued that the rapid development of Silicon Slopes in north Utah County comes at the cost of Utah County's value as agricultural land. I think the choice isn't an either-or proposition, if we can develop sustainably. See [my response at the Deseret News](https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2020/8/21/21376479/guest-opinion-utah-county-preservation-growth-agriculture-natural-resources-infrastructure).
