# Overview

In May and June 2024 I worked with James Smith in my department to lead a 
sophomore-level study abroad to Southeast Asia. We visited the following cities
across a 21-day trip:

  - Phnom Penh, Cambodia
  - Siem Reap, Cambodia
  - Bangkok, Thailand
  - Penang, Malaysia
  - Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
  - Singapore
  
The curriculum for the program was CCE 201 Sustainable Infrastructure (taught by me) and CCE
231 Global Leadership (taught by James).
  
This blog post reflects on the trip, making use of a post-return survey completed 
by the students on the program. It contains notes of what I think went well, 
what didn't work out so well, and what I might want to do differently next time,
supported by data from the survey. 20 students completed the trip, but only 16 
completed the anonymous survey.

# Overall Trip

It was a very fast trip, with our longest stays being only 4 nights (Bangkok) 
or 5 nights (Singapore). Siem Reap, Penang, and Kuala Lumpur were only 2 nights
each. When we asked the students if they wanted more or less time in a place,
their answers largely reflected that they wanted more time in the short stops.

```{r time-in-place, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-time-in-place
#| tbl-cap: Was the time in each city appropriate?
city_list <- c("Phnom Penh", "Siem Reap", "Bangkok", "Penang", "Kuala Lumpur", "Singapore")

tip <- data |> 
  select(cities_1:cities_6) |> 
  set_names(city_list) |> 
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "City", values_to = "Reaction") |> 
  mutate(Reaction = as_factor(Reaction),
         City = factor(City, levels = city_list)) |> 
  group_by(City, Reaction) |> 
  summarise(n = n())

ggplot(tip, aes(y = City, x = n, fill = Reaction)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev) +
  scale_fill_ghibli_d("KikiLight", direction = -1) + theme_bw() + 
  xlab("Number of Students")
```

It would be difficult to keep the same trip length while adding time to any of the
cities. Perhaps a day could be taken from Bangkok or Singapore, but the real answer is
probably to either skip Phnom Penh or make it a 25-day trip.




## Notes for next time.
We were helped greatly on the trip by Praveen Beesa and Melissa Tours, who booked 
our buses, guides, and lodging. It would be good to ensure that we get an itemized
detail of everything they are covering, because there were a few places where we 
believed admissions were covered by Melissa and they were not. It is also good to 
independently check whether the hotels have breakfast; we were informed that the hotel
in Singapore would provide breakfast, but they didn't even have it available.

We should probably do a better job of communicating with the tour organizer about
our expectations for guides and group lunches. We are, after all, not like the
typical retirees or holiday tourists they are used to. Our best guides --- Nee in Bangkok 
and Sum in Siem Reap --- understood that we were up for something a little different,
more self-guided and exploratory. We also probably don't want to roll up to a restaurant
very often, unless it is a group meal that we have explicitly planned on. Food courts 
are more our style, I think.

Remind students that American Express and Discover have much smaller international 
networks, and that a Visa or MasterCard is the only reliable credit card. One of
our students was kind of caught out by this.

# Cultural Visits

By my count, we visted 13 cultural "sites" as a group. Most of the sites received positive
reviews, with a strong positive response for Angkor and the Singapore scavenger hunt.


```{r culture, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
#| label: tbl-culture
#| tbl-cap: How effective was each site at helping you learn about the culture and environments in the region?  
culture <- c("Bokor Mountains", "Killing Fields", "Angkor", "Wat Pho / Wat Phra Kaew",
             "Railway Market and Floating Market", "Penang Heritage Zone", "Penang Hill",
             "Kek Lok Si Temple", "Batu Caves", "Melaka Jonker Street", "Singapore transit / neighborhood hunt",
             "Night Safari", "Rainforest Canopy Walk")
cul <- data |> 
  select(cultural_1:cultural_13) |> 
  set_names(culture) |>  
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "Site", values_to = "Reaction") |> 
  mutate(Reaction = as_factor(Reaction),
         Site = factor(Site, levels = culture)) |> 
  group_by(Site, Reaction) |> 
  summarise(n = n())

ggplot(cul, aes(y = Site, x = n, fill = Reaction)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev) +
  scale_fill_ghibli_d("KikiLight", direction = -1) + theme_bw() + 
  xlab("Number of Students")
```

The reaction to Angkor is unsurprising, given that Angkor is among the most amazing
places on the planet. Our use of mountain bikes there --- and the support we received from
Pheah and Sum and the bike guides --- made an already magical experience truly once-in-a-lifetime.
One student remarked to me that the day on bikes at Angkor Wat was the best day of 
his life to that point. Hopefully he can top it later, but he won't do that 
everyday.

The appreciation for the Singapore scavenger hunt was gratifying; this was an idea
that I cooked up on a visit to Singapore in Fall 2022. We divided the group into 
four teams and had them visit several sites in a pre-planned order (not known to the teams).
When they reached each site, they would send me a selfie of themselves at the site and
I would send them their next destination. The sites were:

  - Sri Veeramakaliamman Hindu temple in Little India
  - Sultan Mosque in Kampong Glam
  - Merlion statue
  - Temple of the Buddha's Tooth in Chinatown
  - St. Andrew's Cathedral
 
At the end of the activity, we all met at Gardens by the Bay for a group satay dinner. 
This activity accomplished two main goals. First, it helped the students appreciate
the syncretic society of Singapore. Second, it taught the students how to get
between interesting places on public transit; it was very rewarding to listen to 
the students during the rest of our time in Singapore talk about how they revisited
the neighborhoods they saw on the scavenger hunt for meals or souvenirs.

The Killing Fields were strongly affecting to the students, as you would expect them
to be. It was probably tough to do these on the first day, but it's hard to imagine
when else you would do them in our schedule, and the students appreciated them.


Lower scores were logged for the Penang Hill and the Bokor Mountains. More on the 
Bokor Mountains when we talk about the technical sites below. Penang Hill was a 
mistake on my part; the best part of it is the rainforest preserve, which I forgot 
had a RM 60 ($15 USD) admission on top of the train. We paid for the funicular 
train to the top of the hill (which is a cool and nice place), but most students 
skipped the rainforest walk. 

We went to church in both Bangkok and Singapore. These are probably the right places 
to go, as the Church is well-established with wards that won't be overwhelmed (like 
the Penang branch might be). It was good to hear from Anan Richins, the first male 
Thai convert to the Church; it was even better perhaps to hear from Anurut, the 
engineer and project manager of the Bangkok Temple who joined the Church during
the temple's construction.

## Notes for next time

The Killing Fields memorial and the Tuol Sleng prison both have excellent self-guided 
audio tours that allow you to pursue the violence and suffering of both sites at your
own pace. Next time we should insist that we do not want a group guide at either
site, but rather to use the audio guides.

If you go to Penang (and I think you should, see the desire for more time there above),
make sure to pay for students to get into the nature preserve.

The Railway market was popular, but was very touristy. I wonder if we could instead
provide instructions for people on how to get there. But maybe it's fine.

Night Safari is a must. Remember that transit there is hard, and that the trains
don't run all night.

Maybe figure out how to go when the Bangkok Temple is open? It was closed for its
annual cleaning when we were there.

# Technical Sites

We also visited eight distinct technical sites, or sites where there was technical
content. 

```{r technical, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
#| label: tbl-technical
#| tbl-cap: How effective was each site at helping you appreciate the infrastructure strategies we studied?
technical<- c("Kamchay Dam", "National Institute of Development Administration",
             "Penang Bridge", "ARUP - Kuala Lumpur",
             "Singapore City Gallery", "Changi Airport",
             "Kajima Corporation", "TeamBuild")

tec <- data |> 
  select(technical_1:technical_8) |> 
  set_names(technical) |>  
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "Site", values_to = "Reaction") |> 
  mutate(Reaction = as_factor(Reaction),
         Site = factor(Site, levels = technical)) |> 
  group_by(Site, Reaction) |> 
  summarise(n = n())

ggplot(tec, aes(y = Site, x = n, fill = Reaction)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev) +
  scale_fill_ghibli_d("KikiLight", direction = -1) + theme_bw() + 
  xlab("Number of Students")
```

The students' best reviewed site was the ARUP office in Kuala Lumpur, where
structural engineer Raymond Chen walked us through the structural design of 
Merdeka 118, the newly completed second-tallest building in the world. We 
talked about why KL has such tall buildings (4 of the world's top 20), and
what it is like to be an engineer or project manager on such a massive and
high-profile project. I was personally blown away.

A unexpectedly great pair of sites were the Singapore City Gallery and TeamBuild.
The first is an urban  planning museum with cool interactive displays and
large-scale 3D models of Singapore's urban spaces and a strong theme of sustainable
growth and energy use. The second is a firm that builds pre-fabricated concrete rooms
for use in Singapore's Housing Development Board (HDB) public housing projects. 
I say unexpected because I planned for the City Gallery visit and James arranged
the TeamBuild visit, but the second site really helped the students see how 
the stated goals of Singapore are operationalized through engineering and 
construction.

## Notes for next time

Dams on the Mekong in Cambodia are a critical sustainability issue with lots of 
interesting elements, but none of them are particularly close to Phnom Penh or Siem
Reap; it's also not clear which ones we could even get close to if we tried. Need
to think through this harder, but Kamchay isn't likely to be a good place for us.

Can we find someone to talk to us about the Penang Bridge?

# Next Time?

I would really love to do this trip as a residential program, where we stay in
Singapore for 8 or 9 weeks, with potentially a 1-week trip to KL and Penang, and
a weekend trip to Bangkok and Angkor. More than half the students indicated that
they still would have likely come. Those who said they would not suggested in a follow-up
question that family obligations or summer jobs would be the primary obstacle.

```{r residential, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-residential
#| tbl-cap: How likely would you be to do a longer program?
tec <- data |> 
  select(Q9) |> 
  mutate(Reaction = as_factor(Q9)) |> 
  group_by(Reaction) |> 
  summarise(n = n())

ggplot(tec, aes(y = "Coming?", x = n, fill = Reaction)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev) +
  scale_fill_ghibli_d("KikiLight", direction = -1) + theme_bw() + 
  xlab("Number of Students")
```

Doing a longer progam would be much less frantic for the directors, who could 
teach the classes locally on a more normal schedule, and would not have to fully
commit to the three week program. But it would cause additional hurdles, and some
students would not come. Of course, others might be more attracted
