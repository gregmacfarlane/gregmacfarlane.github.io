## Description
A two-hour introduction to software version control for transportation analysts. This training is aimed at those who have heard of Git, but have never used it, or who have used it but didnâ€™t really know what they were doing.

## Materials
Participants will need to bring a computer on which they have permissions to install software, or have previously installed
  - Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  - GitHub Desktop (https://desktop.github.com/)   
  - Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
Additionally, participants should create a free account at <github.com> if they have not done so already.

## Learning Outcomes
Participants who complete this course will:
  - Understand and describe the purpose of version control in transportation analysis projects.
  - Create a git repository and commit changes to text files using the command line as well as third-party graphical git clients.
  - Use GitHub to collaborate with others on a shared project.

## Agenda
1. Introduction
  * 15-minute discussion on the purpose of version control.

  * Review Questions
    - Is there a project that you want to move into git for version control?
    - Is there a project that you want to move into GitHub for collaboration?
