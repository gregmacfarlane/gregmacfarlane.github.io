For their term projects this semester, the students in my Intro to Transportation class wrote blog posts summarizing the effects of COVID on various dimensions of transportation. I think they did a great job overall; here are links to the blog posts by topic area:

-   [Aviation](http://joshuaflake.com/)
-   [Travel Behavior](https://bri-hansen36.medium.com/4-ways-the-pandemic-has-forever-changed-our-travel-behavior-516150a9aa49)
-   [Highway Operations](/post/covid-highways/covid-highway-operations/)
-   [Public Transit](https://almajean14.medium.com/effects-of-covid-19-on-public-transit-in-the-u-s-349a6539ad6)
-   [Active Transportation](https://www.et.byu.edu/~dapelu22/Transpo/361_project.html)
-   [Freight](https://jaidieb5.medium.com/freight-and-covid-22f103d4ec2d)
-   [E-Commerce](https://emily-dicataldo.medium.com/e-commerce-transportation-why-we-still-need-to-talk-about-covid-19-impacts-7966759afd17)
-   [Modern Mobility Systems](https://htt489880669.wordpress.com/2021/04/13/ce-en-361-final-project/)

I selected a blog post format for this assignment because I feel the students actually write too many technical reports as engineering majors. Not that these technical reports are unimportant, but a major role of engineers in modern society is to communicate with a less-technical or even a non-technical audience. And frankly, word processing documents are not the way most people read anything anymore. By writing in this more accessible and less formal medium, I hope the students can exercise these outreach muscles.

Also, I love the irony of the header image, which I pulled from the student post on [highway operations](/post/covid-highways/covid-highway-operations/). From a highway operations and safety persepective, slowing down is exactly what [coronavirus did not do](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/the-coronavirus-pandemic-emptied-americas-highways-now-speeders-have-taken-over/2020/05/10/c98d570c-8bb4-11ea-9dfd-990f9dcc71fc_story.html), but it probably should have.
