I came across this graphic from an [APTA Factbook](https://www.apta.com/wp-content/uploads/Resources/resources/statistics/Documents/FactBook/APTA_2011_Fact_Book.pdf)(p. 20) which shows transit with an enormous safety advantage over automobiles. I was curious if I could update the data using information from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

## Passenger Miles

First, we want to get passenger miles traveled by different modes. The BTS has this data in an Excel spreadsheet at <https://www.bts.gov/content/us-passenger-miles>. The data in the spreadsheet is somewhat spotty, and there are *plenty* of footnotes describing the fact that the sources of the different elements have changed over the years. But let's go with just data from 2000 onward.

> I wanted to read the Excel files directly from the BTS website, but there was just too much cleaning that needed to be done to make them machine-readable in a nice way. You can find the lightly modified spreadsheet I used, including a separate analysis from this one, [here](passmiles.xlsx)

```{r passmiles}
# get Excel file from BTS
passmiles <- read_excel(here("posts/safety/passmiles.xlsx"), 
                        skip = 1, sheet = "passenger_miles") %>%
  filter(!is.na(Mode)) %>%
  select(Group, Mode, `2000`:`2018`) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = `2000`:`2018`, names_to = "year", values_to = "passmiles", 
               names_transform = list(year = as.integer)) %>%
  # convert from million miles to miles
  mutate( passmiles = passmiles * 1e6 ) %>%
  distinct() 
```

The numbers in the data table are given in Millions. To keep our units straight, we are going to use straight miles for now.

```{r passmiles-plot}
ggplot(passmiles, aes(x = year, y = passmiles, label = Mode, color = Mode, 
                      group = str_c(Group, Mode))) +
  geom_path() + facet_wrap(~Group, scales = "free_y") + 
  geom_dl(method = list(dl.trans(x = x + 0.2), "last.points", cex = 0.6)) +
  geom_dl(method = list(dl.trans(x = x - 0.2), "first.points", cex = 0.6))  +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1995, 2022)) +
  scale_color_discrete(guide = "none") +
  ylab("Passenger Miles") + xlab("Year") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Fatalities by Mode

The BTS also publishes statistics on fatality broken up by mode at: <https://www.bts.gov/content/transportation-fatalities-modea>. However, there are a number of potential issues arising from these data. First, transit fatalities are grouped by workers and vehicle occupants, but are not separated by mode. Additionally, there are a number of redundant categories.

```{r transportation-fatalities}
fatalities <- read_excel(here("posts/safety/passmiles.xlsx"), 
                        sheet = "fatalities") %>%
  filter(!is.na(Mode)) %>%
  select(Group, Mode, `2000`:`2018`) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = `2000`:`2018`, names_to = "year", values_to = "fatalities", 
               names_transform = list(year = as.integer))
```

```{r fatalities-plot}
ggplot(fatalities %>% filter(Group %in% c("Air", "Highway", "Rail", "Transit")),
       aes(x = year, y = fatalities, label = Mode, color = Mode,  
           group = str_c(Group, Mode))) +
  geom_path() + facet_wrap(~Group, scales = "free_y") + 
  geom_dl(method = list(dl.trans(x = x + 0.2), "last.points", cex = 0.6)) +
  geom_dl(method = list(dl.trans(x = x - 0.2), "first.points", cex = 0.6))  +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1995, 2022)) +
  scale_color_discrete(guide = "none") +
  ylab("Fatalities") + xlab("Year") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Fatalities per 100 Million Miles

Because the two report tables use different modal definitions, we will consider only group-levels with the following pairs:

-   Air: all fatalities and passenger miles
-   Highway: all fatalities and passenger miles, minus bus fatalities and miles
-   Transit: fatalities and passenger miles by rail and non-rail
-   Rail: Only Intercity rail miles; passenger rail fatalities minus transit rail fatalities.

```{r miles-summary}
miles_summary <- passmiles %>% 
  # remove bus miles from highway group
  filter(!(Group == "Highway" & Mode == "Bus")) %>%
  # only keep intercity rail
  filter(!(Group == "Rail" %in% c("Light Rail", "Heavy Rail", "Commuter Rail", "All"))) %>%
  # remove summary miles from all other groups
  filter(!(Group == "Transit" & Mode == "All")) %>%
  filter(!(Group == "Highway" & Mode == "All")) %>%
  # simplify transit modes into rail and non-rail
  mutate(
    Mode = case_when(
      Group == "Transit" & Mode %in% c("Light Rail", "Heavy Rail", "Commuter Rail") ~ "Rail",
      Group == "Transit" ~ "Non-Rail",
      Group == "Highway" ~ "All",
      Group == "Rail" ~ "All",
      Group == "Air" ~ "All",
      TRUE ~ Mode
    )
  ) %>%
  group_by(Group, Mode, year) %>%
  summarise(passmiles = sum(passmiles))
```

```{r fatalities-summary}
fatalities_summary <- fatalities %>%
  mutate(
    keep = case_when(
      # all air
      Group == "Air" & Mode == "All" ~ T,
      # all highway but bus
      Group == "Highway" & !(Mode %in% c("All", "Bus")) ~ T,
      # transit rail  and non-rail
      Group == "Transit" & Mode %in% c("Non-Rail", "Rail") ~ T,
      # passenger rail
      Group == "Rail" & Mode == "All" ~ T,
      TRUE ~ F
    ),
    Mode = ifelse(Group == "Highway", "All", Mode), 
  ) %>% filter(keep) %>%
  group_by(Group, Mode, year) %>%
  summarise(fatalities = sum(fatalities))
  
# remove transit rail fatalities from rail 
transit_rail_fatalities <- fatalities_summary %>% filter(Mode == "Rail") %>% pull(fatalities)
  
fatalities_summary <- fatalities_summary %>%
  mutate(
    transit_rail_fatalities = transit_rail_fatalities,
    fatalities = ifelse(Group == "Rail", fatalities - transit_rail_fatalities, fatalities)
  )
```

Finally, we can join the two datasets together, and compute the fatalities per 100 million miles.

```{r fatal_rate}
fatal_rate <- left_join(miles_summary, fatalities_summary, 
                        by = c("Group", "Mode", "year")) %>%
  mutate(
    fatal_rate = fatalities / (passmiles / 1e8) # fatalities per 100 million miles
  )
```

```{r fatal-rate-plot}
ggplot(fatal_rate, aes(
  x = year, y = fatal_rate, 
  color = str_c(Group, Mode, sep = " "), 
  label = str_c(Group, Mode, sep = " "), 
  )) +
  geom_path() +
  geom_dl(method = list(dl.trans(x = x + 0.2), "last.points", cex = 0.6)) +
  geom_dl(method = list(dl.trans(x = x - 0.2), "first.points", cex = 0.6))  +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1999, 2019)) +
  scale_color_discrete(guide = "none") +
  ylab("Fatalities per 100 Million Passenger Miles") + 
  xlab("Year") + 
  theme_bw()
```

From my understanding, if a light rail train hits a pedestrian, it counts as a highway fatality *and* a transit fatality. Given that a large number of the rail fatalities are due to trespassers and at-grade crossings, this may overstate the safety to rail *passengers*. Also, it double-counts fatalities resulting from a commuter rail train colliding with a private automobile.

My thoughts on the APTA chart:

-   I believe they used Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) instead of passenger miles traveled. Because the average occupancy of a vehicle is somewhat over 1.0, this overstates the relative danger of highway modes.
-   I believe they considered only fatalities among *transit passengers* resulting from *train crashes*, and did not include fatalities among transit workers or other users killed by trains. I believe they did, however, include all highway fatalities, and not simply vehicle occupants. You could make the argument that this is the correct comparison, but I don't believe that it is fair.
