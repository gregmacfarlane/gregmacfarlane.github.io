Understand and describe the purpose of version control in transportation analysis projects.\n\n2. Create a git repository and commit changes to text files using the command line as well as third-party graphical git clients.\n\n3. Use GitHub to collaborate with others on a shared project.\n\n\n## Setup\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n### Needed\n![Git](images/Git-Logo-2Color.png){height=150}\n\n![GitHub / GitHub Desktop](images/GitHub_Logo.png){height=150}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n### Not needed, but I am going to use\n![Visual Studio Code](images/vscode.png){height=200}\n:::\n\n::::\n\n# Why we use Git\n\n## Problem 1\nHow many of you have ended up here?\n\n```sh\nmydocument.docx\nmydocument_final.docx\nmydocument_final_commentsGSM.docx\nmydocument_final_commentsSHA.docx\nmydocument_really_final.docx\nmydocument_really_final_gsmedit again.docx\n```\n\nGoogle docs has made this better, but still not perfect.\n\n## Solution: Version Tracking\n\n![](images/git-commits.png)\n\n\n## Problem 2\n\nChris is working on new code for transit network skimming. Hayden is working on a new external zone design. Neither can wait for the other to be done, but they may need to edit similar files in the travel demand model.\n\n1. Flip coins to see who will go first. Surely the other person can work on something else?\n2. Create a check-out system that prevents two people from editing the code at the same time.\n\n## Solution part 1: Working copies\n\n![Image from Atlassian](images/working_copies.svg)\nMultiple developers can have their own local working copies of a repository.\n\n\n## Solution part 2: Branching \n\nDifferent developers can work on their own branches (commit path). Then, two branches can be merged.\n\n![Image from Atlassian](images/basic_branch.png)\n\n\n## Problem 3\n\nYou have started building the next version of your travel model when you get a report of a bug that needs to be fixed immediately. You have already made lots of changes to the part of the code where the bug is.\n\n1. Throw away the work you are doing on the next version so that you can fix the bug as soon as possible.\n2. Fix the bug alongside everything else, and give your users a fix in the next version. Whenever that is.\n\n## Solution: Branch-based workflow\n\nFormalize how updates are made, based on branches.\n\n![\"Git Flow\" development pattern. Image Atlassian](images/git-flow.svg)\n\n\n## Review\n\n1. What problem does version control solve?\n1. Is there a project you have worked on that would benefit from version control?\n\n# Tutorial Part 1: Working with Git on Your Own\n\n<!-- The first tutorial has them create a new repository on the command line, add a README file to it, and then push to gitHub.-->\n## Create a repository\n\nCreate a new folder, and then start a terminal (git-bash) from inside that folder.\n```sh\n# make this folder a git repository\ngit init\n```\n\n## Add a text file to the respository\n\n```sh\n# start a README file\ntouch README.md\n```\nEdit the file using a text editor, save it, and then check to see the changes.\n\n\n```sh\n# check the repository status\ngit status\n```\n\n## Stage and commit your changes\n\n```sh\ngit add REAME.md\ngit commit -m \"Add initial README file\"\ngit status\n```\n\n## Review\nYou can now keep track of changes to a local file.\n\n1. What is the difference between staging changes and committing changes?\n2. How often should you commit changes?\n\n\n# Tutorial Part 2: Working with others on GitHub\n\n## GitHub uses \"Pull Requests\"\n\n![Image from GitHub](images/branching.webp)\n\nThis helps people collaborate by formalizing discussion related to proposed changes.\n\n## Fork this repository\n\nGo to <https://github.com/gregmacfarlane/udot-gittraining>\n\nPush the \"fork\" button at the top-right, and fork it to your own account.\n\n![](images/fork_repo.png)\n\n## Clone this repository\n\n1. Open GitHub Desktop\n2. Clone your fork to your local computer\n\n## Make an edit\n\n1. Open the file `participants.csv`. \n2. Add your name to the list of participants.\n3. Save, stage, commit, and push.\n\n## Open a pull request\n\n![](images/pull_request.png)\n\n## Participants in this training\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readr)\nread_csv(\"participants.csv\", col_types = \"c\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 Ã— 1\n  Name              \n  <chr>             \n1 Greg Macfarlane   \n2 BYU Transpo Intern\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Review \n\n1. What is the difference between `commit`, `push`, and `pull`?\n2. Is there a project that you want to move into GitHub for collaboration?\n\n## Tutorials for Learning More\n\nLinkedin Learning / DataCamp\n\nAtlassian: <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials>^[Most images came from these tutorials.]\n\nGitHub: <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/git-and-github-learning-resources>\n\n\n",
