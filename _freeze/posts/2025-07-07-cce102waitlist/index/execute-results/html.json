This creates \na logjam where two years of students need to be enrolled at the same time. CFM, CE, and FM graduate together about \n150 students per year, meaning that sets the long-run capacity for the class. Our plan is to offer four sections \nof 60 students per year, with a total capacity of 240 students. This should provide ample space for students who \ntake the class and then switch majors, as well as provide a context for students in other majors who take the class \nas a GE or a minor elective. \n\nDuring the 2024-2025 academic year, we offered six sections of CCE 102 --- in addition to a Spring study abroad \nsection --- with a total capacity of 380 students. This should have been sufficient to clear the backlog of students for \ntwo class years. However, the waitlist for the 2025-2026 academic year remains large. \n\nThis post serves as an analysis of the waitlist for Fall 2025, with an eye to understanding who \nis yet to enroll in the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n## An estimate of the backlog\nI asked Emily Platt to run a report with the university registrar, returning a list of students who are declared\nCE, CFM, or FM majors but who have not yet completed CCE 102 or its predecessor course CCE 201. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbacklog <- read_xlsx(file.path(folder, \"selected_unenrolled.xlsx\")) |>\n  mutate(\n    # simplify major categories\n    major = clean_major(Major),\n    # mark new students\n    new = ifelse(`BYU Total Credits` < 12, TRUE, FALSE),\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe total number of students who are in the majors but who have not yet enrolled is 442.\n@tbl-backlog shows the number of students who have not yet enrolled in CCE 102 by major.\nAbout 1/3 of the backlog  (185 students) are recently enrolled students, meaning that they have completed fewer than\n12 BYU credit hours. These students could be new to BYU as freshmen, or they\ncould have transferred from another school. \n \n\n\n::: {#tbl-backlog .cell tbl-cap='Students without CCE 102'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbacklog |>\n  group_by(major, new) |>\n  summarise(n = n()) |>\n  pivot_wider(names_from = new, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) |>\n  kbl(col.names = c(\"Major\", \"More than 12 credit hours\", \"Less than 12 credit hours\")) |> \n  kable_styling()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'major'.

Some of the students on the backlog may be \nwaiting to declare a different major or withdraw from the university, and therefore show\nup on report but are not actively engaged with the major. It is confusing to me that\nso few of the incoming new students are enrolled or waitlisted, and also that\nthere are so many students on the backlog including those who have to have been\nhere for years.\n\nMy recommendation is that we modestly increase the capacity of the class for Fall 2025. \nI can accommodate 72 students in my section, because I can increase the size of each team.\nI cannot increase the number of teams, because all teams have to make a presentation in \nclass.\n\nIf the overenrollment continues in Winter 2025, we may have to add an additional section. \nBut the added capacity from 2024-2025 should have been sufficient to clear the backlog \nof students who are actively engaged in the major.\n",
