We visited the following cities\nacross a 21-day trip:\n\n  - Phnom Penh, Cambodia\n  - Siem Reap, Cambodia\n  - Bangkok, Thailand\n  - Penang, Malaysia\n  - Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n  - Singapore\n  \nThe curriculum for the program was CCE 201 Sustainable Infrastructure (taught by me) and CCE\n231 Global Leadership (taught by James).\n  \nThis blog post reflects on the trip, making use of a post-return survey completed \nby the students on the program. It contains notes of what I think went well, \nwhat didn't work out so well, and what I might want to do differently next time,\nsupported by data from the survey. 20 students completed the trip, but only 16 \ncompleted the anonymous survey.\n\n![The group at Gardens by the Bay in Singapore](https://byu.box.com/shared/static/1ugv5cl6s9osefkccbq7yd6uh09y3iu6.jpeg){#fig-gardens}\n\n# Overall Trip\n\nIt was a very fast trip, with our longest stays being only 4 nights (Bangkok) \nor 5 nights (Singapore). Siem Reap, Bangkok, and Kuala Lumpur were only 2 nights\neach. When we asked the students if they wanted more or less time in a place,\ntheir answers largely reflected that they wanted more time in the short stops.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-time-in-place .cell tbl-cap='Was the time in each city appropriate?'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2024-06-30-studyabroad_files/figure-html/tbl-time-in-place-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIt would be difficult to keep the same trip length while adding time to any of the\ncities. Perhaps a day could be taken from Bangkok or Singapore, but the real answer is\nprobably to either skip Phnom Penh or make it a 25-day trip.\n\n\n\n\n## Notes for next time.\nWe were helped greatly on the trip by Praveen Beesa and Melissa Tours, who booked \nour buses, guides, and lodging. It would be good to ensure that we get an itemized\ndetail of everything they are covering, because there were a few places where we \nbelieved admissions were covered by Melissa and they were not. It is also good to \nindependently check whether the hotels have breakfast; we were informed that the hotel\nin Singapore would provide breakfast, but they didn't even have it available.\n\nWe should probably do a better job of communicating with the tour organizer about\nour expectations for guides and group lunches. We are, after all, not like the\ntypical retirees or holiday tourists they are used to. Our best guides --- Nee in Bangkok \nand Sum in Siem Reap --- understood that we were up for something a little different,\nmore self-guided and exploratory. We also probably don't want to roll up to a restaurant\nvery often, unless it is a group meal that we have explicitly planned on. Food courts \nare more our style, I think.\n\nRemind students that American Express and Discover have much smaller international \nnetworks, and that a Visa or MasterCard is the only reliable credit card. One of\nour students was kind of caught out by this.\n\n# Cultural Visits\n\nBy my count, we visted 13 cultural \"sites\" as a group. ost of the sites received positive\nreviews, with a strong positive response for Angkor and the Singapore scavenger hunt.\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-culture .cell tbl-cap='How effective was each site at helping you learn about the culture and environments in the region?'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2024-06-30-studyabroad_files/figure-html/tbl-culture-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe reaction to Angkor is unsurprising, given that Angkor is among the most amazing\nplaces on the planet. Our use of mountain bikes there --- and the support we received from\nPheah and Sum and the bike guides --- made an already magical experience truly once-in-a-lifetime.\nOne student remarked to me that the day on bikes at Angkor Wat was the best day of \nhis life to that point. Hopefully he can top it later, but he won't do that \neveryday.\n\n![Bikes at Angkor](https://byu.box.com/shared/static/mda8ec9eqkgq1fvyivuhybgvwin87lqn.jpg){#fig-bikes}\n\nThe appreciation for the Singapore scavenger hunt was gratifying; this was an idea\nthat I cooked up on a visit to Singapore in Fall 2022. We divided the group into \nfour teams and had them visit several sites in a pre-planned order (not known to the teams).\nWhen they reached each site, they would send me a selfie of themselves at the site and\nI would send them their next destination. The sites were:\n\n  - Sri Veeramakaliamman Hindu temple in Little India\n  - Sultan Mosque in Kampong Glam\n  - Merlion statue\n  - Temple of the Buddha's Tooth in Chinatown\n  - St. Andrew's Cathedral\n \nAt the end of the activity, we all met at Gardens by the Bay for a group satay dinner. \nThis activity accomplished two main goals. First, it helped the students appreciate\nthe syncretic society of Singapore. Second, it taught the students how to get\nbetween interesting places on public transit; it was very rewarding to listen to \nthe students during the rest of our time in Singapore talk about how they revisited\nthe neighborhoods they saw on the scavenger hunt for meals or souvenirs.\n\n::: {#fig-scavenger layout-ncol=2}\n\n![Sultan Mosque](https://byu.box.com/shared/static/7ufbawse5oibnto2y60wdqk9uz5x9o7c.jpg){#fig-scav1}\n\n![Merlion](https://byu.box.com/shared/static/oku5z2dj0smrn3w18u9bg4hbqu8u38s5.jpg){#fig-merlion}\n![Little India](https://byu.box.com/shared/static/hj4cqdjuqoy53ue9cver0120wkyqoh9u.jpg){#fig-tooth}\n\nScavenger hunt selfies\n:::\n\nThe Killing Fields were strongly affecting to the students, as you would expect them\nto be. It was probably tough to do these on the first day, but it's hard to imagine\nwhen else you would do them in our schedule, and the students appreciated them.\n\n\nLower scores were logged for the Penang Hill and the Bokor Mountains. More on the \nBokor Mountains when we talk about the technical sites below. Penang Hill was a \nmistake on my part; the best part of it is the rainforest preserve, which I forgot \nhad a RM 60 ($15 USD) admission on top of the train. We paid for the funicular \ntrain to the top of the hill (which is a cool and nice place), but most students \nskipped the rainforest walk. \n\nWe went to church in both Bangkok and Singapore. These are probably the right places \nto go, as the Church is well-established with wards that won't be overwhelmed (like \nthe Penang branch might be). It was good to hear from Anan Richins, the first male \nThai convert to the Church; it was even better perhaps to hear from Anurut, the \nengineer and project manager of the Bangkok Temple who joined the Church during\nthe temple's construction.\n\n## Notes for next time\n\nThe Killing Fields memorial and the Tuol Sleng prison both have excellent self-guided \naudio tours that allow you to pursue the violence and suffering of both sites at your\nown pace. Next time we should insist that we do not want a group guide at either\nsite, but rather to use the audio guides.\n\nIf you go to Penang (and I think you should, see the desire for more time there above),\nmake sure to pay for students to get into the nature preserve.\n\nThe Railway market was popular, but was very touristy. I wonder if we could instead\nprovide instructions for people on how to get there. But maybe it's fine.\n\nNight Safari is a must. Remember that transit there is hard, and that the trains\ndon't run all night.\n\nMaybe figure out how to go when the Bangkok Temple is open? It was closed for its\nannual cleaning when we were there.\n\n![Students at Bangkok Temple](https://byu.box.com/shared/static/5cokd797ojzehwxhheacmdfulhcmphkt.jpg){#fig-temple}\n\n# Technical Sites\n\nWe also visited eight distinct technical sites, or sites where there was technical\ncontent. \n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-technical .cell tbl-cap='How effective was each site at helping you appreciate the infrastructure strategies we studied?'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2024-06-30-studyabroad_files/figure-html/tbl-technical-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe students' best reviewed site was the ARUP office in Kuala Lumpur, where\nstructural engineer Raymond Chen walked us through the structural design of \nMerdeka 118, the newly completed second-tallest building in the world. We \ntalked about why KL has such tall buildings (4 of the world's top 20), and\nwhat it is like to be an engineer or project manager on such a massive and\nhigh-profile project. I was personally blown away.\n\n::: {#fig-merdeka layout-ncol=2}\n\n![Learning about the structural engineering of Merdeka 118 at the ARUP office in KL](https://byu.box.com/shared/static/wcu4x6el90jy810oiih2v9k1ews2zqsx.jpeg){#fig-arup}\n\n![At the base of the tower](https://byu.box.com/shared/static/xjiqkdnnnakn1xn4d84ktug7fa4lut8v.jpg){#fig-merdeka}\n\nMerdeka 118\n::: \n\nA unexpectedly great pair of sites were the Singapore City Gallery and TeamBuild.\nThe first is an urban  planning museum with cool interactive displays and\nlarge-scale 3D models of Singapore's urban spaces and a strong theme of sustainable\ngrowth and energy use. The second is a firm that builds pre-fabricated concrete rooms\nfor use in Singapore's Housing Development Board (HDB) public housing projects. \nI say unexpected because I planned for the City Gallery visit and James arranged\nthe TeamBuild visit, but the second site really helped the students see how \nthe stated goals of Singapore are operationalized through engineering and \nconstruction.\n\n![TeamBuild](https://byu.box.com/shared/static/gprnfthjcdk1vy8ikzxd7zmliepjwo6q.jpeg)\n\n## Notes for next time\n\nDams on the Mekong in Cambodia are a critical sustainability issue with lots of \ninteresting elements, but none of them are particularly close to Phnom Penh or Siem\nReap; it's also not clear which ones we could even get close to if we tried. Need\nto think through this harder, but Kamchay isn't likely to be a good place for us.\n\nCan we find someone to talk to us about the Penang Bridge?\n\n# Next Time?\n\nI would really love to do this trip as a residential program, where we stay in\nSingapore for 8 or 9 weeks, with potentially a 1-week trip to KL and Penang, and\na weekend trip to Bangkok and Angkor. More than half the students indicated that\nthey still would have likely come. Those who said they would not suggested in a follow-up\nquestion that family obligations or summer jobs would be the primary obstacle.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-residential .cell tbl-cap='How likely would you be to do a longer program?'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2024-06-30-studyabroad_files/figure-html/tbl-residential-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nDoing a longer progam would be much less frantic for the directors, who could \nteach the classes locally on a more normal schedule, and would not have to fully\ncommit to the three week program. But it would cause additional hurdles, and some\nstudents would not come. Of course, others might be more attracted\n\n![The group at Angkor Wat at sunrise.](https://byu.box.com/shared/static/m5uzf5jdgaonrpn5c23wtvxqz52l9o0y.jpg)",
