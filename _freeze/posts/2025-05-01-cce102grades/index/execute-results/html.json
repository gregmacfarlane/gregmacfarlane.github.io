This post serves to document and\nrecord how the students performed in each section and by major. Across the four sections,\n238 students completed the course. The average GPA by section has not been \nconsistent across all four sections, however.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata |>\n  group_by(semester, section) |>\n  summarise(count = n(), `gpa` = mean(final_gpa)) |>\n  kbl(digits = 2, col.names = (c(\"Semester\", \"Section\", \"Count\", \"Average GPA\"))) |> \n  kable_styling()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'semester'.

These\npercentile grades do not include any final curve adjustments. Each section\nreached its GPA in different ways. Fall 2024  section 003 had a number of\nstudents earning low but passing C grades, while Winter 2025 001 had a few\nstudents perform poorly and earn E grades.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data, aes(x = current_pct, color = str_c(semester, section, sep = \" \"))) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.25) +\n  scale_color_manual(\"Section\", values = pal) +\n  theme_bw() + xlab(\"Un-curved Final Grade\") + ylab(\"Density\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Grade distribution by section.](index_files/figure-html/fig-gradedist-1.png){#fig-gradedist width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWinter 2025 felt much better in terms of student attitude and workload. At the same\ntime, the average grades were a little bit lower. I'm curious how the student evaluations\nshake out.\n\nNow let's consider the breakdown across majors, which I show in @fig-grademaj. Note that\nthis is a GE class, with 10 different majors enrolled. However,\n92% of students are enrolled in either Civil Engineering (CE) or in Construction\nand Facilities Management (CFM), where this class is required. CE\nstudents do better in the class, with the mode being about an A-. CFM majors have\na wide distribution, but the mode is in the B range. Other majors --- including\na few environmental science students and multiple open majors --- perform more\nlike CE students, with a few poor performing exceptions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data, aes(x = current_pct, color = major)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.25) +\n  scale_color_manual(\"Major\", values = pal) +\n  theme_bw() + xlab(\"Un-curved Final Grade\") + ylab(\"Density\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Grade distribution by section.](index_files/figure-html/fig-grademaj-1.png){#fig-grademaj width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe final grades awarded by all semesters (including with a curve applied) are \nshown in @fig-final. The most common grade awarded to all students in all majors is an A,\nparticularly when combined with the A- grades. But there are probably too many CFM\nstudents earning B- and C grades to make me happy. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata |>\n    mutate(final_grd = factor(final_grd, levels = c(\"A+\", \"A\", \"A-\", \"B+\", \"B\", \"B-\", \"C+\", \"C\", \"C-\", \"D+\", \"D\", \"D-\", \"E\", \"W\"))) |>\n    ggplot(aes(x = final_grd, fill = major)) +\n    geom_bar(, position = \"dodge\") +\n    xlab(\"Final Grade\") + ylab(\"Number of Students\") +\n    scale_fill_manual(\"Major\", values = pal) +\n    theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Final Grades awarded by major, all semesters.](index_files/figure-html/fig-final-1.png){#fig-final width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe chart above does not contain withdrawals, as students who withdraw do not remain on my rolls. I \ncannot therefore track what major the withdrawn students are enrolled in. But I can compute the\noverall DEW rate for both semesters, shown in @tbl-dew. This rate has come down, but \nit would be nice to get it below 5%.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-dew .cell tbl-cap='DEW Rate by Semester'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# withdrawals\nwithdrawals <- tibble(semester = c(\"Winter 2025\", \"Fall 2024\"), w = c(3, 4))\n\ndata |>\n    mutate(de = case_when(\n      str_detect(final_grd, \"D\") ~ TRUE,\n      str_detect(final_grd, \"E\") ~ TRUE,\n      TRUE ~ FALSE\n    )) |>\n    group_by(semester) |>\n    summarise(n = n(), de = sum(de))  |>\n    left_join(withdrawals, by = \"semester\") |>\n    mutate(dew = (de + w) / (n + w) * 100)  |>\n    kbl(col.names = c(\"Semester\", \"N Complete\", \"D/E\", \"W\", \"DEW [%]\"), digits = 2)  |>\n    kable_styling()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Semester </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> N Complete </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> D/E </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> W </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> DEW [%] </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Fall 2024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 113 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 7 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 9.40 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Winter 2025 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 125 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 7 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 7.81 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n",
