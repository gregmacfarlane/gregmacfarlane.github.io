In November 2019, the Utah Transit Authority launched an on-demand microtransit service in south Salt Lake County in partnership with a private mobility operator. This paper reports the results of an expressed preferences survey of 130 transit riders in the microtransit service area that was collected before and immediately after the service launched. There is not a clear relationship between current transit access mode and expressed willingness to use microtransit, although some responses from new riders indicate the novel service competes most directly with commercial transportation network company operations. The survey responses also reveal younger passengers express a more than expected willingness to use microtransit, middle-aged passengers a less than expected willingness, and older passengers neutral or no expressed opinion. The results suggest additional relationships between household size and transit use frequency, but further research is necessary. The effect of other user characteristics, including income and automobile availability, is less statistically clear and requires further research.","tags":[],"title":"Rider Perceptions of an On-Demand Microtransit Service in Salt Lake County, Utah","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"For their term projects this semester, the students in my Intro to Transportation class wrote blog posts summarizing the effects of COVID on various dimensions of transportation.

Speaking of that morning, Cromar recalled his boss\u0026rsquo;s greeting: \u0026ldquo;Good morning, nice to see you, Brian. Go home. Go home now, leave the office, take whatever you need to start working from home. I don’t know when I’ll see you again.\u0026rdquo; While Cromar\u0026rsquo;s sudden departure from the workplace was more urgent due to an immunosuppressed family member, it was one among many necessary but costly disruptions. The sudden advent of COVID-19 sent shockwaves through every aspect of interstate highway operations, construction, and funding across the United States.\nFewer but Faster While Cromar began to work from home, other CDOT engineers and technicians were issued essential worker papers to present to officers enforcing the Stay-At-Home order at traffic stops enroute to project sites, a practice adopted in many communities across the country. As various state governments issued these Stay-At-Home orders in early 2020, traffic volumes on highways decreased by 50% to 65% in many states, with some cities, like San Francisco, dipping as much as 85%, according to a study done by the American Society of Civil Engineers.\nIn the early days of the shutdown, the decreased volumes on the roads brought with them a decrease in crashes and fatalities. Unfortunately, this didn’t last. As the weeks wore on, those who continued to drive after the shut down grew comfortable with the empty roads and began driving more recklessly, reaching extremes of 40 miles-per-hour over the speed limit. Brian Cromar confirmed this in his interview: \u0026ldquo;About three weeks to a month after the pandemic hit is when we started noticing that the drivers who never stopped going to work everyday started enjoying the lack of traffic on the roadways\u0026rdquo; he remembers. \u0026ldquo;Where everyone in the 75 mph zone was often going 80-85 mph pre-pandemic, they were [now] going 90-95 mph routinely.\u0026rdquo;\nUsually, the high traffic volume on highways is one of the key factors that keep the speed of traffic flow close to the speed limit and within safe parameters for the roadway design and sight distance. When the roads emptied, drivers suddenly seemed to feel safe at unsafe speeds, leading to an uncanny increase in car crashes. The National Conference of State Legislatures found that the higher speeds at these low traffic volumes led to a sharp increase in crash rates and a higher rate of fatalities. It was also at about three weeks in that Brian Cromar\u0026rsquo;s team began noticing \u0026ldquo;upticks in crashes that were completely avoidable due to the speeds.\u0026rdquo;\nWhile the high speeds brought unexpected danger to largely empty roads, the relationship between low volumes and dangerous speeds has been consistent in the months following the lock down as different pandemic related restrictions began to ease. Because of that, the volumes on highways are once again on the rise, bringing crash statistics to more familiar levels as well. The recovery rate has not been very fast but by May of 2020, the volumes had already returned to 30% of what they had been pre-pandemic. Of course, speeding remains a very real issue, but it is only as much as it had been before COVID-19 struck.\nConstruction Challenges and Opportunities Dangerous speeds were not the only unexpected change the pandemic brought to everyday highway operations. Because Brian Cromar oversees material testing across highway improvement project timelines, he became very familiar with both the opportunities and pitfalls the pandemic presented to the highway improvement programs. Because of decreased volumes, he reported that some construction projects progressed much faster than was typical. Customarily, construction on highways in the region of Colorado in which he operates must take place in the middle of the night, when there are the fewest cars on the road and needed lane closures are safest. However, with the advent of the pandemic, construction contractors were able to safely close down more of the highway at a time and accelerate construction on select highway improvement projects. Cromar cited one project that had been completed in a fraction of the expected timeline due to the ability to close an entire intersection without creating unsafe traffic congestion. The reconstruction was completed in a matter of weeks, whereas the original plan would have taken several months to safely close and reroute traffic section by section.\nWhile these accelerated projects presented positive effects of the pandemic, they were the exception rather than the norm. Larger projects saw significant delays due to the local and global supply chain failures characteristic of 2020, Cromar reported. The expense of these delays were borne by the state rather than the contractors, who were not at fault. While many projects nationwide saw delays, many more were cancelled altogether. A large share of projects in nearly every state were defunded in a push to comply with COVID protocols (Figure 1. Source: ARTBA). The American Road and Transportation Builders Association specifies that an estimated $9.6 billion in transportation projects have been delayed or canceled entirely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and economic downturn. $132.8 billion of funding initiatives have failed, and $33.2 billion have been lost due to diverted funding or budget cuts as a result of the pandemic. (See Figure 1)\nFinancial Shortcomings In the economic downturn we see now, state and local governments still appear hesitant to impose new taxes to fund these projects. Public funds have been directed instead towards saving small businesses, reducing substantial pandemic-related deficits, and other programs intended to help their constituents in more immediate ways. Many state and local governments see infrastructure projects as non-essential or not pressing, and therefore we have seen a trend of prioritizing immediate economic relief. With all these reductions in financial support for infrastructure projects in recent months, construction jobs are also on the decline. ARTBA estimates that up to 2.3 million jobs could be lost, which would only contribute to the downturn of United States Highway quality.\nFor Brian Cromar, failures in transportation funding have thrown off several projects across the State of Colorado. For example, due to the shifting nature of the pandemic, Cromar saw a contractor walk away from a contract in the middle of a project because of internal financial difficulties. Another kind of stress came when a project to reconstruct one side of a major stretch of highway was expanded to repair, but not replace, the opposite side as well. This may seem like an upgrade, but the alteration was due to a dismal calculation that the funds required to complete, meaning the full project could not be secured for another 35-40 years.\nUnfortunately, shortages in financial support for United States highway systems are not unique to the pandemic era. Funding for these necessary improvement projects typically stem from three sources: fuel tax, sales tax, and tolls. With the decreased traffic volumes mentioned earlier, all three of sources saw significant declines against the backdrop of a system already overdue for reform. For the past 5 years, the Fixing America\u0026rsquo;s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act has provided financial stability and security for the 50 Departments of Transportations around the country, providing much of the financial support necessary to maintain and replenish America’s highway networks. The FAST Act will expire in October of 2021, after receiving a one-year extension by congress in response to the pandemic, at which point the policies and allocation of highway improvement funds will once again come under legislative review.\nIn fact, the extension of the FAST Act was in response to an urgent plea for aid. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Organizations (AASHTO) – the organization that represents all 50 Departments of Transportation – sent a report to the United States Congress early April of 2020 detailing America\u0026rsquo;s urgent infrastructure situation in light of the ongoing pandemic. In their report, AASHTO estimated 30% in state transportation revenues would be lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic and throughout the next 18 months. Because of the loss of these funds and the expiring FAST Act, AASHTO urged congress to address infrastructure issues in their next Coronavirus Relief Bill. Their response, as mentioned previously was to extend the FAST Act by a year and include additional funds in several of their relief measures. But much like the extended highway reconstruction project Cromar oversaw, Congress\u0026rsquo;s action has patched up, but not replaced a system that will need reconstruction soon.\nLooking Forward Fortunately, as the United States approaches the tail end of this pandemic, the future of infrastructure may not be as bleak as it appears. On March 31, 2021, the Biden administration released a massive infrastructure improvement proposal; the very first point on the fact sheet released by the White House reads, \u0026ldquo;President Biden\u0026rsquo;s plan will: Fix highways, rebuild bridges, upgrade ports, airports and transit systems.\u0026rdquo; The plan invests millions in repairing 20,000 miles of highways and other main roads, in turn creating countless \u0026ldquo;good-paying, union jobs.\u0026rdquo; The funds included in this proposal would not be drawn from gas tax and sales tax, but from an increase in corporate taxes. Should this plan receive the support of Congress and be implemented, many of the losses projected by ARTBA from the COVID-19 pandemic would be eased and averted, minimalizing the long-term effects the pandemic has had on the progress of highway transportation.\nAs the nation continues to recover and move towards more familiar patterns, some trends - and deficits - have become more obvious than ever before. From the impact of empty roads on fatal crash rates, to the spasmodic disruptions of highway construction, to the precarious financial mechanisms behind the great American highway system, the COVID-19 Pandemic brought with it serious consequences and valuable lessons. What the nation does with these new insights and exposed weaknesses will determine the future of our highway infrastructure.\n","date":1617235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617235200,"objectID":"4e3adea896c67c36c03ed79c08e8bf57","permalink":"/post/covid-highways/covid-highway-operations/","publishdate":"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/covid-highways/covid-highway-operations/","section":"post","summary":"This is a post written by the listed student authors as part of their term project for Introduction to Transportation Engineering in Winter 2020.\n As he entered the office on the morning of Friday March 13th, 2020, Brian Cromar, a Civil Engineer Technician for the Colorado Department of Transportation, was immediately sent home.

In this paper we apply a comprehensive measure of park accessibility drawn from random utility choice theory, which avoids arbitrary assertions of proximity while incorporating potentially numerous amenities and attributes of both the parks and the population. We apply this utility-based accessibility measure to correlate Census tract-level obesity and physical activity rate estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 500 Cities project with tract-level American Community Survey socioeconomic data in New York City, paired with geographic open space data from New York City. Controlling for the socioeconomic variables and spatially correlated error terms, we show a positive and significant relationship between park access and physical activity rates. The data also suggest a negative relationship between park access and obesity rates, beyond what is expected through physical activity and socioeconomics. In doing so, this research contributes a more comprehensive modeling approach for measuring the impact of park access on health, and may improve our understanding of the role  parks and access to them can serve in furthering public health objectives.","tags":["Parks","Accessibility"],"title":"Modeling the impacts of park access on health outcomes: a utility-based accessibility approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeffrey Glenn","Madeline Bluth","Mannon Christianson","Jaymie Pressley","Austin Taylor","Gregory S.

Data were collected using an online survey emailed to registered e-scooter users. A total of 1070 users completed the survey. Descriptive variable statistics and chi-squared analysis were performed to determine variable dependent relationships and equality of proportions. The most common destinations reported were “just riding around for fun”, home, and dining/shopping. The two most common modes of transportation that would have been used if e-scooters were not available were walking (43.5%) and using a personal vehicle (28.5%). Riding behavior was equally mixed between on the street, on the sidewalk, and equal amounts of both. e-Scooters in Provo are likely having both positive (e.g., air pollution) and negative impacts on health (e.g., injuries, physical inactivity).

Given that a large number of the rail fatalities are due to trespassers and at-grade crossings, this may overstate the safety to rail passengers. Also, it double-counts fatalities resulting from a commuter rail train colliding with a private automobile.\nMy thoughs on the APTA chart:\n I believe they used Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) instead of passenger miles traveled. Because the average occupancy of a vehicle is somewhat over 1.0, this overstates the relative danger of highway modes. I believe they considered only fatalities among transit passengers resulting from train crashes, and did not include fatalities among transit workers or other users killed by trains. I believe they did, however, include all highway fatalities, and not simply vehicle occupants. You could make the argument that this is the correct comparison, but I don’t believe that it is fair.

In this paper we present a park activity location choice model estimated from a passive origin-destination dataset --- supplied by StreetLight Data, Inc.~--- representing trips to parks and green spaces in Alameda County, California. The estimated model parameters reveal heterogeneous preferences for park size and willingness-to-travel across block-group level socioeconomic segmentation: Specifically, high-income block groups appear more positively attracted to larger parks, and block groups with a high proportion of ethnic minority individuals are more likely to select nearby parks.

The passive data are generally used, in this case, to expand and adjust behavioral models estimated from a small-sample local household survey. Recently, there has been interest in deriving synthetic records of individual travel directly from the passive data, with the support of other datasets. Kressner (2017) previously developed a method to build synthetic daily activity and travel patterns for a complete population. In this method, simulated individuals used the 2009 NHTS as a basis for tour patterns while passive origin-destination matrices spatially locate the simulated tours within a specific region. In this work, we update our tour patterns to the 2017 NHTS and comment on observed differences in the resulting simulated travel patterns. Specifically, we consider the temporal distribution of weekday trips. We also examine the consequences of these differences in the synthesized daily schedules and in their traffic assignment. The results show that the NHTS has a similarly high proportion of mid-day, off-peak travel in both 2009 and 2017, and that this proportion is higher than other comparable local household surveys. The results also show that the change from the 2009 to the 2017 dataset does not substantively affect the simulated demand or assignment in a data-driven travel model using NHTS data.","tags":null,"title":"Comparing the Daily Schedules in the NHTS from 2009 and 2017","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["blog"],"content":"Last summer I did some work with my friend and colleague Josie Kressner applying our data-driven model to potential AV scenarios.

There has been interest in using passive data for travel modeling, but existing trip- and tour-based models require a direct link between demographics and trip-making behavior that is uncommon in passive data. This project demonstrates an attempt to overcome these limitations by building an agile tour-based model with passive data using an innovative person-based discrete event simulation framework. The simulation-based model is compared with a modern trip-based model recently developed for the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) and the French Broad River Metropolitan Planning Organization (FBRMPO) covering the Asheville region in North Carolina. Demand trip tables from both models are fed into the region’s static assignment model and validated against traffic counts. The assignment results are similar in terms of average link error against traffic count data; this is the case even though the simulation-based passive data model was neither calibrated to local conditions nor adjusted with scaling factors or shadow prices. A discussion of costs, development time, complexity, and usability between NCDOT's recent aggregate trip-based model and the new tour-based model constructed from passive data are provided. We believe the new modeling approach developed through this research will be a good fit for small and medium-sized communities, as it permits tour-based models to be developed with substantially less investment in time, money, and data.","tags":null,"title":"Using passive data to build an agile tour-based model: A case study in Asheville","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461736800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461736800,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

We provide evidence that a general-to-specific model selection methodology that relies on the generality of the spatial Durbin model (SDM) should be preferred to the classical specific-to-general methodology that begins with an assumption of no spatial effects. We show that applying the SDM raises the estimate of MWTP for transit proximity in Atlanta but also widens its confidence interval, relative to ordinary linear regression.

Though these services are widely used, their impact on overall transit ridership remains unclear. The objective of this research is to assess the effect of real-time information provided via web-enabled and mobile devices on public transit ridership. An empirical evaluation is conducted for New York City, which is the setting of a natural experiment in which a real-time bus tracking system was gradually launched on a borough-by-borough basis beginning in 2011. Panel regression techniques are used to evaluate bus ridership over a three year period, while controlling for changes in transit service, fares, local socioeconomic conditions, weather, and other factors. A fixed effects model of average weekday unlinked bus trips per month reveals an increase of approximately 118 trips per route per weekday (median increase of 1.7% of weekday route-level ridership) attributable to providing real-time information. Further refinement of the fixed effects model suggests that this ridership increase may only be occurring on larger routes; specifically, the largest quartile of routes defined by revenue miles of service realized approximately 340 additional trips per route per weekday (median increase of 2.3% per route). Although the increase in weekday route-level ridership may appear modest, on aggregate these increases exert a substantial positive effect on farebox revenue. The implications of this research are critical to decision-makers at the country’s transit operators who face pressure to increase ridership under limited budgets, particularly as they seek to prioritize investments in infrastructure, service offerings, and new technologies.","tags":[],"title":"The impact of real-time information on bus ridership in New York City","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregory S Macfarlane","Laurie A Garrow","Patricia L Mokhtarian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1427868000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1427868000,"objectID":"d72b182845e6c4ce22a9b46a6451da50","permalink":"/publication/learnedpreferences/","publishdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/learnedpreferences/","section":"publication","summary":"This study explores the relationship between historical exposure to the built environment and current vehicle ownership patterns. The influence of past exposure to the built environment on current vehicle ownership decisions may be causal, but there are alternative explanations. Households may primarily select to live in neighborhoods that facilitate their vehicle ownership preferences, or they may retain preferences that they have developed in the past, irrespective of their current situations. This study seeks to control for these alternative explanations by including the built environment attributes of households’ past residences as an influence on vehicle ownership choices. We use a dataset from a credit reporting firm that contains up to nine previous residential ZIP codes for households currently living in the 13-county Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area. Results show that past location is significant, but of marginal influence relative to the attributes of the current location. From a practical perspective, our results suggest that models that include current but not past neighborhood attributes (also controlling for standard socioeconomic variables) can forecast vehicle ownership decisions reasonably well. However, models that include both current and past neighborhood attributes can provide a more nuanced understanding of the built environment’s potentially causal influences on vehicle ownership decisions. This better understanding may provide more realistic forecasts of responses to densification or other travel demand management strategies.","tags":null,"title":"The influences of past and present residential locations on vehicle ownership decisions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregory S Macfarlane","Juan Moreno-Cruz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420095600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420095600,"objectID":"56d8851d03a1b83c22b3a231f419c291","permalink":"/publication/resiliency/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/resiliency/","section":"publication","summary":"Public rail transit infrastructure and other features of the urban environment shape housing markets, as neighborhoods with high accessibility also tend to be highly valued.

The Church has owned this property for a while, and has already begun construction on the adjacent Philadelphia Temple, to be opened in 2016.\nThe Church is no stranger to urban development. A central doctrine of early Mormonism was the idea of Zion, a city where the faithful would gather to prepare the world for the return of Christ. Joseph Smith and Brigham Young each built their own cities, in Nauvoo (Illinois) and Salt Lake City, according to ideals of community participation and ideal civic life. As Mormons colonized the intermountain west, they invariably placed at the center of their cities a temple or chapel of some sort (see: Provo, Ogden, Logan, Saint George). In the past decade, the Church has constructed a string of urban meetinghouses or temples in places such as Hong Kong and Manhattan. The Church also has a great deal of experience with urban commercial land development, having completed the City Creek project in downtown Salt Lake City early last year.\nWhy would any church invest in commercial properties at all? Surely some would say (and have said) the money would be better spent on church operations, or on humanitarian and welfare missions. When City Creek was announced, Church\nPresident Gordon B. Hinckley said\n Renewed vitality at the head of Main Street will result in increased vitality throughout the entire city. We of the Church have wanted to keep our city youthful and attractive. People come here to Temple Square from all over the world in ever-increasing numbers, and it is important that we keep the Square and its environs beautiful and inviting.\n I think that this is some of the rationale behind the Philadelphia investment. I\u0026rsquo;ve never spent time in Philadelphia, but my friend (and Penn alum) James Wong confirmed \u0026ldquo;that part of Philly has been in need of some love.\u0026rdquo; Perhaps the Church is hoping to ensure that the temple is in the best neighborhood possible, and is willing to make that neighborhood itself if it must.\nIf this is true, why is Philadelphia the first city (outside Utah) to get this treatment? Are other temples not in need of similar protection? I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed several periods and styles of temple placement (without clearly defined beginnings or ends and with plenty of exceptions):\n 1836-1900: temples are planned to be the centerpieces of new Mormon communities (Nauvoo, Salt Lake, Logan, Saint George) 1900-1995: temples are built in suburbs of cities where there are strong Mormon congregations (Sandy Springs (Atlanta GA), Silver Spring (DC,MD), Glenview (Chicago IL)) 1995-present: smaller temples are built in suburban areas where there are active congregations \u0026ldquo;far\u0026rdquo; from an existing temple (such as the temples \u0026ldquo;in\u0026rdquo; Louisville, Nashville, Raleigh, Columbia, Birmingham, and Orlando).  Philadelphia will join Salt Lake City, Hong Kong, Copenhagen, and New York in the elite club of cities with decidedly urban temples (perhaps the new Provo City Center Temple should count?). But Salt Lake fits clearly in Phase 1, and the other three (4?) are all outliers built for special congregations. Does the Philadelphia Temple represent a new phase for the Church? Here\u0026rsquo;s a thought exercise: if Philadelphia had gotten its temple in 1996, would it not go in Norristown? Or if London were getting a temple today (instead of 1958), who would ever put it in Newchapel?\nA suburban religion? There is a strong trend in wider North American society to reclaim central cities and make them pleasant places for people to live, work, and socialize. Millenials are buying cars at much lower rates than our parents\u0026rsquo; generations, and are much more likely to live in urban areas. With college-aged and young professional people far more likely to join the Church than older, more set individuals, it seems obvious that the official \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a Mormon\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; advertising campaign should be aimed primarily at these young urbanites. But if the nearest Church building requires a half-hour drive out of the city, a young investigator who gets around on her bike is going to find showing up on Sunday difficult.\nI had a conversation with a college classmate about a month ago, where he expressed his reluctance to apply for a job in the Salt Lake valley, citing the \u0026ldquo;way politics in Salt Lake is going.\u0026rdquo; It was clear he didn\u0026rsquo;t like that Salt Lake has a democratic mayor and a liberal city council. I think the recent (albeit temporary) legalization of gay marriage in Utah also frightened him. Cities generally are overwhelmingly progressive, and in suburban-oriented thought can appear as harbors of sin and villainy. And short of iniquity, the benefits sometimes attributed to urban life \u0026mdash; sustainability, a wider range of dining options, a vehicle-free lifestyle \u0026mdash; may not be valued by traditional suburban Mormons.\nSo what are we, as Mormons, to make of the Church\u0026rsquo;s investments in central cities? Surely the Church is not frightened of Salt Lake City, and is going to great expense to make the city \u0026ldquo;youthful and attractive.\u0026rdquo; The investment in Philadelphia shows that the Church is reaching out to other areas as well. Perhaps the Latter-day Saints should take note.\n","date":1392249600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1392249600,"objectID":"e4fc8fc2f44a4e116fd9f03ad956aaab","permalink":"/post/urbanchurch/urban-temples/","publishdate":"2014-02-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/urbanchurch/urban-temples/","section":"post","summary":"Last night I read the surprising announcement that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is financing the development and construction of a 32 floor residential and commercial building in the heart of downtown Philadelphia.

Fishman, in the quote above this essay, argues that the modern city has completely disintegrated into the homes of its residents in an extreme polycentrism that is fundamentally different from what existed before. There was once a true center, in “some downtown business district,” and now there is not; each family or domestic unit has turned themselves inward towards their own lives and home rather than engaging with society around a particular core. This perspective is certainly valid, but is nonetheless urban-centric. There is a parallel perspective – if not necessarily a competing one – that the “true center” was never in that business district to begin with.\nWhat Fishman means by “true center” is clear from an account he repeats of a Beverly Hills family whose several members travel hundreds miles over Los Angeles as part of their daily routine, observing “Each family was its own ‘core’ in a decentralized city” (Fishman 1987, 172). The difference between Los Angeles and previous metropolises is that the activities Fishman describes (or their pre-modern equivalents) would have occurred closer to the home; or rather, the home would have been situated closer to the activities. It can be argued that the “true center” has always been within each residence but that these centers overlapped in the preindustrial (or even the pre-automobile) city, giving the illusion of mono-centric form dominated by an urban core. Cities were always poly-centric, but the multiple centers happened to be stacked in two-dimensional space. In this view, a latent demand for the decentralization of urban areas is enabled by the automobile and other technologies and their concomitant reduction in transportation costs, rather than caused by the inventions. This latent demand also inspired federal policies designed to facilitate the divorcement of suburbs from urban centers.\nIn this essay, I discuss how the cost of transportation is a primary mechanical influence on the existence of cities, how changing transportation costs would enable decentralization, and how cities may or may not decentralize further with future improvements in telecommunication technologies. This leads to a discussion of the social attitudes underlying decentralization and the resulting policies that made decentralization possible.\nA Location Theory Perspective \nCities exist at all, in a microeconomic context at least, as a result of two related but distinct phenomena: economies of agglomeration and economies of scale. Firms in general wish to maximize profits by decreasing their marginal cost of producing goods and by selling as many of those goods as possible to the market. Agglomeration is the effect of firms seeking locations with the lowest labor and capital costs. Large manufacturers locate near points where their costs of production would be lowest, and attract supporting firms that sell to the manufacturers, their laborers, or draw from a trained labor force. Economies of scale result from the fact that twice the expenditure in capital and labor can produce more than twice the number of goods, at least to a point. A single craftsman must understand how to construct each element of his product; two craftsmen can divide the tasks and specialize in a particular part of the process, producing more together than both could separately. Whereas agglomeration provides the motivation for a city in the first place, scale encourages that agglomeration to be as large as economically possible.\nThe desire for firms to exploit economies of aggregation and scale through advantageous location leads to competition in the urban land market. Service firms (offices) claim the centermost points because these firms value proximity to other firms to reduce the transportation time costs of their relatively expensive labor but require little space, and can consequentially afford to outbid all others. Manufacturers require more space but also have high transportation costs for their goods, encouraging them to bid for the next most central locations. Residences are pushed to the periphery because their transportation costs are low; “they need only transport themselves to and from their workplace twice each day” (Moore et al., 2007, p. 30). Using more competitive land for residences would be expensive and would result in sub-optimal housing environments, a truth implied in the hope that Sunnyside Gardens could be designed “for more spacious and beautiful living without additional cost” (Stein and Wright 1951, p. 22). The result of these several processes is a mono-centric city. But as transportation costs decrease, the particular placement of firms matters less. Agglomeration effects are spread over a larger distance, and so there is more incentive for manufacturers to scale on the most affordable land possible rather than cluster together. Eventually, the poly-centric city is inevitable.\nTelecommunications Technologies The advent and continued improvement of advanced telecommunications technologies will certainly have an impact on urban form and scale. Whether its effect will be further population dispersal, however, cannot be confidently claimed. At some point the theory of locational competition will collide with the observed decision-making behavior of people as the cost of a service drops.\nLocation theory considered independently would predict continuing decentralization. Telecommunications can be seen as a replacement for physical transportation, rendering transportation costs inconsequential and incentivizing firms and households to occupy as much land as they were willing to acquire. Service workers could work entirely from home, and even manufacturing labor could operate their sophisticated machinery remotely. Friedman observes, after describing JetBlue’s practice of using Utah homemakers as call center workers from within their own homes, “Homesourcing (sic) to Salt Lake City and outsourcing to Bangalore [are] just flip sides of the same coin … it is now possible for companies and individuals to source work anywhere” (Friedman 2007, 40). The situation he observes is not dissimilar from the science fantasy constructed by Moore et al., where they imagine the effect of matter transporters on urban scale: “Households and firms would spread themselves widely. … Just as in high-cost [of transportation] medieval times, in this low-cost future, production and population would be spread out.” (Moore et al. 2007, p. 21) This is of course working under the assumption that the natural desired state of households is away from others.\nThis assumption, however, might be in conflict with Jevons’ paradox, developed after he observed English firms did not lessen their total expenditure on coal when its price dropped. Rather, the firms capitalized on the opportunity to acquire more coal with their existing budget. This same phenomenon has been observed with fuel-efficient vehicles, whose owners tend to drive them more and therefore erase some part of the savings (Small and Van Dender 2005). It might be that improved telecommunications will lower the cost of human connections, and people would then desire to have more of them. “All those electronic interactions are creating a more relationship-intensive world, … and those relationships need both e-mail and interpersonal contact.” (Glaeser 2012, p. 38) The time spent on each relationship may decrease as transportation or communications costs drop, but the total relationship time spent by humans may not. When information is free and rapid the competitive distinction of firms will be personal connections, as in London of the eighteenth century, “Its leading merchants depended on rapid knowledge that was available to them only through a multitude of face-to-face contacts” (Fishman 1987, p. 21). A desire to be in contact with more people could in fact encourage development in central cities, if that is where the most genuine connections are to be had.\nA Word on Residences The arguments for structural location theory break down, in my view, when considering the behavior of residents as transportation costs decrease. Households in a purely economic construction do not benefit from economies of scale. Manufacturers might acquire cheaper land away from the urban center in an effort to enlarge their operations, but households would only seek to decentralize if they derived utility from the act. The existence of such utility in separation is the subject of the next section.\nA Rational Planning Perspective Why would households decentralize if they were not being outbid for their land? Households gain more from their homes and properties than simply a location in space; there are social and cultural factors that influence their choice of residence. And one of those factors, throughout American urban history, seems to be that a preponderance of people don’t want to live in a distinctly “urban” area. Even before the invention of steam locomotives, ferries to Brooklyn drew away Manhattan workers with a combination of “easy access, pleasant surroundings, cheap land, [and] low taxes” (Jackson 1987, p. 29). Ebenezer Howard lauded the benefits of the country as “the symbol of God’s love and care for man” (Howard 1898, p. 349). Planners in the early part of the twentieth century saw urban areas as problems to be solved, through carefully planned neighborhoods subsidized by the state.\nThe idea that proper planning alone could solve such sweeping problems as urban blight relies on a mechanistic worldview; effects have causes, problems have solutions, and the struggle merely lies in finding the correct causes. “If the problem to be solved could be reduced to a set of independent subproblems (sic), then the solution to the whole was nothing more than the sum of the solution of its parts.” (Ackoff 1974, p. 10) For the members of the Regional Planning Association of America (RPAA), crowded and dirty and noisy urban areas were the cause of a list of societal ills, and the solution was a new type of residential system built around Ebenezer Howard’s Garden City ideal. The project in Radburn, NJ, illustrates the solutions that the RPAA devised: separate networks for vehicles and pedestrians, a dendritic progression of street classes, the provision of public and private green space, and segregation of land uses into residential and commercial purposes (Stein and Wright 1951, p. 46, Figure 23). The problem with the Radburn/RPAA plan, and with mechanism in general, is that the cause-effect relationship may be overly simplistic for a system as complicated as a city. The RPAA did not anticipate the self-centering feedback loops in the Radburn prototype: with each successive neighborhood inspired by Radburn the private green space expanded at the expense of the public, pedestrian paths were discarded and vehicles became the exclusive transport mode, and commercial activities were pushed further and further from the homes. In short, they inspired the Fishman Decentralization Assertion that motivates this essay.\nRegardless of these subsequent problems, the truth that so many neighborhoods have been constructed in the Radburn heritage is a testament to the emotional power of the Garden City ideal, and also to the power of the federal government to shape social geography.\nFederal Housing and the Great Depression A number of new or expanded federal programs aimed at stabilizing or stimulating the economy during the Great Depression have driven the decentralization of urban areas. The Home Owners Loan Corporation, in a practice largely continued by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to the present day, insured home loans against default; banks relied on this insurance to resume lending after the crash, and the HOLC-turned-FHA used its position to impel the banks to create terms favorable to lenders. To protect itself from undue risk, the agency developed a neighborhood-based appraisal system to classify the quality of its insured mortgages. These “security maps” gave higher assessment scores to new, white neighborhoods that followed more or less the RPAA ideals. “Although HOLC appraisers marked down [some older] neighborhoods because of true slum conditions, their negative attitudes toward city living in general also affected their judgments” (Jackson 1987, 201). Insuring an urban mortgage became more costly for lenders, and so were offered to homeowners on less favorable terms. An additional result of the FHA’s preference for low-risk properties is the de facto institutionalization of discriminatory lending practices.\nThese terms encouraged by the FHA’s insurance policies were themselves powerful decentralizing tools. Virtually every working person could afford a fully-amortized, thirty-year fixed rate loan on a modest home in a suburban neighborhood, and so virtually everyone acquired such a home. Prior to the FHA, “the provision of decent homes for low paid workers was an economic impossibility” (Stein and Wright 1951, 39). In the post-war period as the effects of FHA loans were combined with veteran’s benefits, the proportion of Americans living in owner-occupied residences increased by twenty percentage points (Jackson 1987, 216).\nSteps Back Were the federal government to identify recentralization as a goal, two policies would have the largest effect. The first would be to eliminate the home mortgage interest tax deduction. The deduction is an effective mandate for home ownership, and it subsidizes the purchase of large homes at the expense of apartment-dwellers. The marginal benefit of owning a (probably suburban) home would decrease relative to a (likely semi-urban) apartment building, and more people would choose the apartment. A second policy would be to internalize the costs of the transportation system by assessing user fees on highways and waterways. The full cost of a trip (on almost any mode) is rarely borne by the traveler; reducing the subsidy on transportation would incentivize shorter trips, and would bring the disparate “centers of the new suburb” closer to each other.\nIn closing this section, it should be noted that the vision of the RPAA did not evolve in a vacuum, nor were the federal policies designed to implement it foisted upon an unwilling populace. “It is hazardous to condemn a government for adopting policies in accord with the preference of a majority of its citizens.” (Jackson 1987, p. 216) People from all walks of life elected to move into suburbs, and the form’s enduring popularity may spell doom for these proposals.\nConclusion The story presented thus far, and retold in this essay, is one of decentralization; households that used to live in core areas moved to suburbs. But this story alone is mathematically implausible given the large population shifts from rural to urban areas. “The highly developed societies of today are the first dominantly urban societies in history” (Ackoff 1974, 5). Immigration and self-generated urban population growth together cannot explain the proportional abandonment of rural areas. The story of suburban expansion in the United States must be one of aggregation at least as much as it is one of dispersal. People accustomed to open spaces and social independence might not eagerly adapt to the crowded and tumultuous conditions of pre-suburban cities. Using my own history as an admittedly narrow anecdote, few of my progenitors back through the fifteenth century (at least) lived in anything more than a shepherd’s village until my grandfather moved into an American suburb in the 1950’s. Never for these people certainly, and maybe for no one, was the center of their lives anywhere but within the walls of their own homes.\nReferences Ackoff, R. 1974. “The Revolution We Are In.” In Redesigning the Future, 3–15.

Our model finds a relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and emissions failures after controlling for vehicle characteristics; that is, given two identical vehicles, the one owned by a low-income or minority household is more likely to fail emissions.

I love Doc\u0026rsquo;s response:\n I\u0026rsquo;m sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955, it\u0026rsquo;s a little hard to come by.\n The irony in this statement of course being that in spite of sweeping changes to fashions, music, politics – and Marty\u0026rsquo;s own mother – plutonium is still mercifully difficult to obtain, and the future Doc Brown had to contract with Libyan terrorists to get some. Sometimes the future doesn\u0026rsquo;t come as fast as we think it might.\nAt the end of the movie, Doc returns from 2015 having outfitted the Delorean with turbofan VTOL tires and a \u0026ldquo;Mr. Trash\u0026rdquo; appliance that generates 1.21 Gigawatts from household food scraps. I haven\u0026rsquo;t made up my mind as to whether this epilogue continues the irony of the plutonium comment or whether Zemeckis falls into the same trap that he set for Doc Brown, imagining an impossibly technological future. Certainly science moves quickly. The line between tech journalism and science fiction can seem very thin, particularly when we live in a world of synthetic hamburgers and augmented reality Almost none of my friends had cell phones in high school, and now most middle schoolers seem to. On the other hand, 2015 is sixteen months away, and I don\u0026rsquo;t see any flying cars or household nuclear reactors.\n\nSo what are we as transportation professionals to make of Elon Musk\u0026rsquo;s Hyperloop? Is this the transport mode of the future, or a literal pipe dream? My first reaction is that Musk seems to have put considerably more thought into the physics of this system than similar proposals, like ET3. Indeed, I think enclosed-tube transportation systems solve lots of the obvious safety issues involved with high speed objects traveling near ground level. If I were to dream up a new mode of transportation, it would probably look a lot like this.\nI am an engineer in the loosest sense, and I\u0026rsquo;m not a physicist at all, so I can\u0026rsquo;t really comment on the feasibility of the mechanisms. But I can look at the volume calculations. Based on Musk\u0026rsquo;s design abstract, the maximum passenger limit of the Hyperloop is 3360 passengers per hour.2 Certainly in operation the efficiency will be lower as passengers board and alight. If you discount it by 30%, the total volume of the system is roughly that of a freeway lane[4. With an average occupancy just north of 1.1], but considerably lower than an intercity rail line. Scaling the system for higher volume routes such as the northeast corridor would only be possible with multiple tubes. This is of course not prohibitive, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t mentioned. In all, I think we can pass him on this metric.\nMore worrying is the discussion of energy use. The \u0026ldquo;energy per passenger journey\u0026rdquo; presumably doesn\u0026rsquo;t include the amortized production energy from the vehicles and the infrastructure.3 With each pod carrying a large battery made of rare or heavy metals and running on a tube made from high-performance steel, it will seem a little less attractive from an energy standpoint. More importantly, I really don\u0026rsquo;t buy the argument that the steel in the tube and the concrete in the pylons is going to be any less voluminous than the steel rails and concrete ties they are supposed to replace. Musk really needs to run through these numbers again.\nPerhaps counter-intuitively, the discussion of unsolved problems is where he really goes off the rails. Certainly there are problems to be worked out, and Musk acknowledges this. The white paper lists the following unresolved challenges (last page):  More expansion on the control mechanism for Hyperloop capsules, including attitude thruster or control moment gyros. Detailed station designs with loading and unloading of both passenger and passenger plus vehicle versions of the Hyperloop capsules. Trades comparing the costs and benefits of Hyperloop with more conventional magnetic levitation systems. Sub-scale testing based on a further optimized design to demonstrate the physics of Hyperloop.  These issues are minutely specific, whereas some of the most fundamental ones have not been addressed. He treats the problem of you know, consumer demand for such a system, as given. Of course people want to take the fastest, cheapest option! But human choices are more complicated than that. Intercity mode choice is a function of cost and time to be sure, but people will also pay for comfort, familiarity, convenience, and other attributes. An enormous part of the best econometric models of transportation choice is the appropriate treatment of residual random error.\nThat Musk hasn\u0026rsquo;t fully processed the demand equation is evident on the home page, where he says that his system is most appropriate for trips shorter than about 1500 miles, because \u0026ldquo;Around that inflection point, I suspect that supersonic air travel ends up being faster and cheaper.\u0026rdquo; Well, London had supersonic commercial air service before it had Lady Thatcher, and there wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough demand for it to justify updating the Concorde. Musk may blame this on international regulations against overland sonic booms, but there are are plenty of transoceanic routes that should have worked4 except the Concorde\u0026rsquo;s speed limited its range and passenger volume. Its unique attribute is precisely what made it economically infeasible, and Musk\u0026rsquo;s inability to recognize this makes me doubt his seriousness.\nBesides, why sell himself short? If you count airport-to-city center trips in the time calculation, Hyperloop could beat the Concorde to LA from Atlanta.\nBut the single thing that shows me this project is not going to be running anytime soon? The thing that shows Musk is a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who mistakenly thinks the world around him is waiting for him to solve its problems, and that if he applies his superior mind to them, they will be?
