      <description>Last week the Deseret News ran a contributed opinion piece by Andrew Skabelund1 in which he argued that the rapid development of Silicon Slopes in north Utah County comes at the cost of Utah County&amp;rsquo;s value as agricultural land. I think the choice isn&amp;rsquo;t an either-or proposition, if we can develop sustainably. See my response at the Deseret News.
