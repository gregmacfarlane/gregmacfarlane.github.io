Further, current practical techniques ignore that when transportation networks are damaged or degraded, people potentially change destinations and modes as well as travel routes. In this research, we develop a model to examine network highway resilience based on changes to mode and destination choice logsums, and apply this model to 41 scenarios representing the loss of links on the statewide highway network in Utah. The results of the analysis suggest a fundamentally different prioritization scheme than would be identified solely through a methodology based on increased travel times. Beyond this, the comparable user costs of the logsum method are generally lower than those considering only the value of increased travel times.\n\nPhoto by Ethan Dow on Unsplash"

In this research, we present a daily activity pattern choice model for multiple person type segments including an individual’s wheelchair use as an explanatory variable. The model results show a strong negative impact of wheelchair use on out-of-home travel, exceeding the impact of other variables commonly considered in such models. We then apply the estimated model within an activity-based model for the Wasatch Front region in Utah; the results suggest a shift in tour making of sufficient scale—among both wheelchair users and those in their households—to warrant further scrutiny and analysis.\n\nPhoto by Lisanto on Unsplash"

Journal of Transport and Land Use, 15(1), 587–612. https://doi.org/10.5198/jtlu.2022.2009\n\n\nDuring the spring and summer of 2020, cities across the world responded to the global COVID-19 pandemic by converting roadway facilities into open pedestrian spaces. These conversions improved access to public open space, but measuring the variation in that improvement among different populations requires clear definitions of access and methods for measuring it. In this study, we evaluate the change in a utility-based park accessibility measure resulting from street conversions in Alameda County, California. Our utility-based accessibility measure is constructed from a park activity location choice model we estimate using mobile device data – supplied by StreetLight Data, Inc. – representing trips to parks in that county. The estimated model reveals heterogeneity in inferred affinity for park attributes among different sociodemographic groups. We find, for example, that neighborhoods with more lower-income residents and those with more residents of color show a greater preference for park proximty while neighborhods with higher incomes and those with more white residents show a greater preference for park size and amenities. We then apply this model to examine the accessibility benefits resulting from COVID-19 street conversions to create a set of small park-like open spaces; we find that this has been a pro-social policy in that Black, Hispanic, and low-income households receive a disproportionate share of the policy benefits, relative to the population distribution.\n\nPhoto by Dollar Gill on Unsplash"

Procedia Computer Science. 238, pp. 91-96. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2024.06.002\n\n\n\nRecent research has shown the power of large-scale regional traffic simulations—such as MATSim—to model the systemic impacts and costs of capacity-reducing incidents. At the same time, observational studies have illustrated the potential for traffic Incident Management Teams (IMTs) to reduce these impacts and costs on a local scale; mathematical optimization models have also attempted to scale or locate these programs. In this research, we connect these two separate lines of scholarly inquiry by simulating the dynamic response of an IMT fleet to incidents arising on a metropolitan highway network. We introduce a MATSim module that handles stochastically-generated incidents of varying severity, dispatches IMT to clear the incidents based on path distance and availability, and measures excess user costs based on the incidents. We apply this module in a scenario with data from the Salt Lake City, Utah metropolitan region. We demonstrate the potential use of the module through an illustrative experiment increasing the IMT fleet size with a collection of simulated incident days.\n\nPhoto by UDOT"

Smart Cities 4, 717-727. https://doi.org/10.3390/smartcities4020036\n\n\nOn-demand microtransit services are frequently seen as an important tool in supporting first and last mile operations surrounding fixed route high frequency transit facilities, but questions remain surrounding who will use these novel services and for what purposes. In November 2019, the Utah Transit Authority launched an on-demand microtransit service in south Salt Lake County in partnership with a private mobility operator. This paper reports the results of an expressed preferences survey of 130 transit riders in the microtransit service area that was collected before and immediately after the service launched. There is not a clear relationship between current transit access mode and expressed willingness to use microtransit, although some responses from new riders indicate the novel service competes most directly with commercial transportation network company operations. The survey responses also reveal younger passengers express a more than expected willingness to use microtransit, middle-aged passengers a less than expected willingness, and older passengers neutral or no expressed opinion. The results suggest additional relationships between household size and transit use frequency, but further research is necessary. The effect of other user characteristics, including income and automobile availability, is less statistically clear and requires further research.\n\nPhoto by Paul Hanaoka on Unsplash"

Public Health, 17, 6344. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176344\n\n\nElectric scooters (e-scooters) are an increasingly popular form of transportation in urban areas. While research on this topic has focused primarily on injuries, there are multiple mechanisms by which e-scooter share programs may impact health. The aim of this study is to explore the health-related behaviors of e-scooter users and to discuss their implications for public health. Data were collected using an online survey emailed to registered e-scooter users. A total of 1070 users completed the survey. Descriptive variable statistics and chi-squared analysis were performed to determine variable dependent relationships and equality of proportions. The most common destinations reported were “just riding around for fun”, home, and dining/shopping. The two most common modes of transportation that would have been used if e-scooters were not available were walking (43.5%) and using a personal vehicle (28.5%). Riding behavior was equally mixed between on the street, on the sidewalk, and equal amounts of both. e-Scooters in Provo are likely having both positive (e.g., air pollution) and negative impacts on health (e.g., injuries, physical inactivity). Future research should further explore patterns of e-scooter use and explicitly examine the linkages between e-scooters and areas of health beyond just injuries.\n\nPhoto by Gotrax on Unsplash"

In this paper, we apply a comprehensive measure of park accessibility drawn from random utility choice theory, which avoids arbitrary assertions of proximity while incorporating potentially numerous amenities and attributes of both the parks and the population. We apply this utility-based accessibility measure to correlate Census tract-level obesity and physical activity rate estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 500 Cities project with tract-level American Community Survey socioeconomic data in New York City, paired with geographic open space data from New York City. Controlling for the socioeconomic variables and spatially correlated error terms, we show a positive and significant relationship between park access and physical activity rates. The data also suggest a negative relationship between park access and obesity rates, beyond what is expected through physical activity and socioeconomics. In doing so, this research contributes a more comprehensive modeling approach for measuring the impact of park access on health, and may improve our understanding of the role parks and access to them can serve in furthering public health objectives.\n\nPhoto by Arek Adeoye on Unsplash"

All vehicles that meet certain criteria must pass an emissions test as part of the vehicle registration process. States use different criteria to determine which vehicles must be tested; however, the equity impacts associated with various screening criteria are unknown. This is due to difficulties researchers have faced in linking vehicle and household characteristics. We investigate the relative influence of vehicle and household characteristics on emissions failures in Atlanta, Georgia, by linking its emissions testing database to a targeted marketing database; the latter contains information about vehicle owners. We use count and hurdle models to predict vehicle emissions failures. Our model finds a relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and emissions failures after controlling for vehicle characteristics; that is, given two identical vehicles, the one owned by a low-income or minority household is more likely to fail emissions. We use our model to investigate the impacts of different emissions testing policies by income and ethnic groups.\n\nPhoto by Jacek Dylag on Unsplash"

The bus requests TSP based on its unpublished schedule, but users perceive only a headway. Quantile regression models estimated on raw timepoint data from the BRT system reveal that TSP significantly improves headway adherence, after controlling for peak times, direction, and cumulative trip dwell time. We also find that requiring the bus to be 2 minutes late before requesting TSP improves headway adherence more than allowing all buses to request TSP.\n\nPhoto by Taylor Vick on Unsplash"

    "text": "Last night I read the surprising announcement that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is financing the development and construction of a 32 floor residential and commercial building in the heart of downtown Philadelphia. The Church has owned this property for a while, and has already begun construction on the adjacent Philadelphia Temple, to be opened in 2016.\nThe Church is no stranger to urban development. A central doctrine of early Mormonism was the idea of Zion, a city where the faithful would gather to prepare the world for the return of Christ. Joseph Smith and Brigham Young each built their own cities, in Nauvoo (Illinois) and Salt Lake City, according to ideals of community participation and ideal civic life. As Mormons colonized the intermountain west, they invariably placed at the center of their cities a temple or chapel of some sort (see: Provo, Ogden, Logan, Saint George). In the past decade, the Church has constructed a string of urban meetinghouses or temples in places such as Hong Kong and Manhattan. The Church also has a great deal of experience with urban commercial land development, having completed the City Creek project in downtown Salt Lake City early last year.\nWhy would any church invest in commercial properties at all? Surely some would say (and have said) the money would be better spent on church operations, or on humanitarian and welfare missions. When City Creek was announced, Church\nPresident Gordon B. Hinckley said\nI think that this is some of the rationale behind the Philadelphia investment. I’ve never spent time in Philadelphia, but my friend (and Penn alum) James Wong confirmed “that part of Philly has been in need of some love.” Perhaps the Church is hoping to ensure that the temple is in the best neighborhood possible, and is willing to make that neighborhood itself if it must.\nIf this is true, why is Philadelphia the first city (outside Utah) to get this treatment? Are other temples not in need of similar protection? I’ve noticed several periods and styles of temple placement (without clearly defined beginnings or ends and with plenty of exceptions):\nPhiladelphia will join Salt Lake City, Hong Kong, Copenhagen, and New York in the elite club of cities with decidedly urban temples (perhaps the new Provo City Center Temple should count?). But Salt Lake fits clearly in Phase 1, and the other three (4?) are all outliers built for special congregations. Does the Philadelphia Temple represent a new phase for the Church? Here’s a thought exercise: if Philadelphia had gotten its temple in 1996, would it not go in Norristown? Or if London were getting a temple today (instead of 1958), who would ever put it in Newchapel?"

    "text": "A suburban religion?\nThere is a strong trend in wider North American society to reclaim central cities and make them pleasant places for people to live, work, and socialize. Millenials are buying cars at much lower rates than our parents’ generations, and are much more likely to live in urban areas. With college-aged and young professional people far more likely to join the Church than older, more set individuals, it seems obvious that the official “I’m a Mormon”” advertising campaign should be aimed primarily at these young urbanites. But if the nearest Church building requires a half-hour drive out of the city, a young investigator who gets around on her bike is going to find showing up on Sunday difficult.\nI had a conversation with a college classmate about a month ago, where he expressed his reluctance to apply for a job in the Salt Lake valley, citing the “way politics in Salt Lake is going.” It was clear he didn’t like that Salt Lake has a democratic mayor and a liberal city council. I think the recent (albeit temporary) legalization of gay marriage in Utah also frightened him. Cities generally are overwhelmingly progressive, and in suburban-oriented thought can appear as harbors of sin and villainy. And short of iniquity, the benefits sometimes attributed to urban life — sustainability, a wider range of dining options, a vehicle-free lifestyle — may not be valued by traditional suburban Mormons.\nSo what are we, as Mormons, to make of the Church’s investments in central cities? Surely the Church is not frightened of Salt Lake City, and is going to great expense to make the city “youthful and attractive.” The investment in Philadelphia shows that the Church is reaching out to other areas as well. Perhaps the Latter-day Saints should take note."

    "title": "Improving Crosswalk Safety in Provo",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Recently we have encountered some encouragement from BYU Risk Management & Safety to cross safely. Now, this indicates a few things. First, BYU considers crosswalks dangerous enough that students should be warned. Second, that there are safety steps pedestrians should be taking. Lastly, warnings about crosswalks are given to pedestrians, but it takes two to tango.\nThere isn’t anything inherently wrong with warning pedestrians about crossing safely, but drivers are the ones providing most of the danger here. BYU may feel that they have more control over the student body and believe that most of us are pedestrians, but in another advice postfrom BYU Risk Management, they use almost 450 words to give ideas about how to cross the street more carefully. The only advice they give to drivers is, “Please devote all of your skills and attention to driving your vehicle, especially when around pedestrians. Never use electronic devices while driving. Pull over if the call is urgent. And wear your seatbelt.” Surely if crossing the street requires a full page of advice on what clothes to wear and where to cross, then drivers can be told to do more than the bare minimum. All of the advice they give to drivers are already legal requirements.\nMore directions should be given to drivers about how to interact with pedestrians, and more infrastructure should be built up to help drivers recognize pedestrian crossings and keep pedestrians safe.\nThere are three main pieces of infrastructure that would make a big difference, and Provo already uses all three. Raised crosswalks, pedestrian refuges and bulb curbs make crossing safer for pedestrians and encourage drivers to slow down. The following is a brief examination of all three.\nRaised crosswalks: We see these on Center Street and on Campus Drive. The crosswalks are built to be level with the sidewalks, forcing the cars to go up and over a speed table. This increases the elevation of the pedestrians, which makes them easier to see. Because pedestrians don’t have to walk down into the road, and cars have to move up, it promotes a psychological idea that pedestrians have the right of way. And the speed table forces the cars to slow down. The federal Department of Transportation reports that raised sidewalks can reduce crashes by 45%.\nPedestrian refuge: Right outside the Rec Center on 500 North there is a pedestrian refuge. In the median of the road, a little concrete pad is built with posts around it so pedestrians can wait there safely. This lets the pedestrian only consider one direction of traffic at once, which cuts in half the distance they have to travel. The Department of Transportation reports that pedestrian refuges can reduce crashes by 32%.\nCurb bulbs, also known as curb extensions, serve a double purpose of calming traffic and making it easier for pedestrians to cross. We see examples of these on 200 East. At street intersections, the curb bulges out. This makes the distance that pedestrians cross shorter, and it also constricts the road which encourages drivers to slow down. Due to the bulge, pedestrian visibility increases because cars parked on the side of the street are no longer blocking their view.\nA prime example of a crosswalk that should have been designed better is on 900 E connecting the VASA parking lot to the gas station across the street. This crosswalk has the best intentions; it comes fully equipped with neon orange flags and constantly flashing lights. While this may appear helpful on paper, it truly isn’t. The flashing lights don’t turn off, leading to the drivers becoming accustomed to the seeming annoyance. The typical student/pedestrian doesn’t know what the flags are to be used for or are too embarrassed to carry them proudly across the street. Thus, pedestrians are forced to scurry across the road when there are no cars rather than drivers being alert to the pedestrians’ needs. Even then it’s hard to find a gap long enough to cross during and I often find myself running toward the second half of crossing because cars refuse to slow down even though that is the law. A traffic signal may be nice here, but if not, we suggest putting in rectangular rapid flashing beacons (RRFB). These lights are brighter than the lights currently found there and are triggered by a push button, making drivers aware of a present pedestrian instead of ignoring the never-ending flashing light. A pedestrian refuge median would also help pedestrians feel safer. More in depth research would be needed for this since taking out that middle lane would be harder for turning vehicles, but ultimately safety is more important. At the very least, the city should put in street lights at this intersection. Currently, there are no street lights on 900 E, or at least none that are bright enough, for someone to feel safe in the dark. This increases the risk for pedestrian harm; drivers already won’t stop if they see you and will definitely not stop if they can’t see you.\nThe crosswalk between Cougar Dental and Southend Market on 700 E immediately south of campus is another example of a crosswalk that needs additional safety measures. There are three main factors that make this intersection unsafe: First, it is used frequently by pedestrians. The grocery store is immediately adjacent and produces a lot of foot traffic. Second, it is extremely close to the bend in the road that turns into 900 N. This creates a blind corner for the rapidly moving southbound traffic. Finally, there is another intersection just a few hundred feet south, where 800 N connects to 700 E. Many cars make the northbound turn, and it is difficult for pedestrians to properly gauge the speed of cars as they make the turn.\nUnfortunately, traffic calming measures would be difficult to implement at this location. The road is narrow and doesn’t need a refuge. The left turn needs to be preserved for cars coming out of 800 N and cars coming out of Campus Drive, so a median or curb extension isn’t feasible. A raised crosswalk seems promising, but the UVX line uses this portion of 700 E, and it is important to keep the bus moving as quickly as possible, not to mention that a speed table would be uncomfortable for the riders. The only options remaining are signage, flashing lights, and perhaps a different colored crosswalk, which are better than nothing. So again, we recommend putting in RRFB lights so that cars will be aware of pedestrians crossing the road. The US Federal Highway Administration reports that flashing lights can increase motor vehicle yielding by 98% and reduces pedestrians involved by 47%.\nIn conclusion, while pedestrians should take caution while crossing the road, we recommend that better infrastructure be built to help cars be more aware of pedestrians so they feel safer. At the crosswalk on 900 E, if a normal traffic light isn’t found necessary or is too costly, a pedestrian refuge would be appreciated to separate crossing each side of the road due to the wider road and a street lamp should be installed on both sides for added visibility. For both that crosswalk and the crosswalk near Cougar Dental, we recommend putting in RRFB lights. It should not take an accident for us to take action. We need to be proactive in the safety of our pedestrians today. Provo and Orem areas should know better since in 2018, a 15-year-old boy was hit and killed and in 2022, a 21-year-old woman was hit and killed. As cited in this article, the father of the girl who died said this, “As we work to improve our infrastructure, these things can be prevented.” Provo, the time is now to improve road infrastructure to improve pedestrian safety. Even the installation of rectangular rapid flashing beacons and extra street lamps can go a long way. Let’s help pedestrians feel safe to cross by improving our infrastructure to increase visibility and help alert drivers when pedestrians are near."

Not that these technical reports are unimportant, but a major role of engineers in modern society is to communicate with a less-technical or even a non-technical audience. And frankly, word processing documents are not the way most people read anything anymore. By writing in this more accessible and less formal medium, I hope the students can exercise these outreach muscles.\nAlso, I love the irony of the header image, which I pulled from the student post on highway operations. From a highway operations and safety persepective, slowing down is exactly what coronavirus did not do, but it probably should have."

Given that a large number of the rail fatalities are due to trespassers and at-grade crossings, this may overstate the safety to rail passengers. Also, it double-counts fatalities resulting from a commuter rail train colliding with a private automobile.\nMy thoughts on the APTA chart:\n\nI believe they used Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) instead of passenger miles traveled. Because the average occupancy of a vehicle is somewhat over 1.0, this overstates the relative danger of highway modes.\nI believe they considered only fatalities among transit passengers resulting from train crashes, and did not include fatalities among transit workers or other users killed by trains. I believe they did, however, include all highway fatalities, and not simply vehicle occupants. You could make the argument that this is the correct comparison, but I don’t believe that it is fair."

Speaking of that morning, Cromar recalled his boss’s greeting: “Good morning, nice to see you, Brian. Go home. Go home now, leave the office, take whatever you need to start working from home. I don’t know when I’ll see you again.” While Cromar’s sudden departure from the workplace was more urgent due to an immunosuppressed family member, it was one among many necessary but costly disruptions. The sudden advent of COVID-19 sent shockwaves through every aspect of interstate highway operations, construction, and funding across the United States."

    "text": "Fewer but Faster\nWhile Cromar began to work from home, other CDOT engineers and technicians were issued essential worker papers to present to officers enforcing the Stay-At-Home order at traffic stops enroute to project sites, a practice adopted in many communities across the country. As various state governments issued these Stay-At-Home orders in early 2020, traffic volumes on highways decreased by 50% to 65% in many states, with some cities, like San Francisco, dipping as much as 85%, according to a study done by the American Society of Civil Engineers.\n\n\n\nBrian Cromar and his team pre-pandemic\n\n\nIn the early days of the shutdown, the decreased volumes on the roads brought with them a decrease in crashes and fatalities. Unfortunately, this didn’t last. As the weeks wore on, those who continued to drive after the shut down grew comfortable with the empty roads and began driving more recklessly, reaching extremes of 40 miles-per-hour over the speed limit. Brian Cromar confirmed this in his interview: “About three weeks to a month after the pandemic hit is when we started noticing that the drivers who never stopped going to work everyday started enjoying the lack of traffic on the roadways” he remembers. “Where everyone in the 75 mph zone was often going 80-85 mph pre-pandemic, they were [now] going 90-95 mph routinely.”\nUsually, the high traffic volume on highways is one of the key factors that keep the speed of traffic flow close to the speed limit and within safe parameters for the roadway design and sight distance. When the roads emptied, drivers suddenly seemed to feel safe at unsafe speeds, leading to an uncanny increase in car crashes. The National Conference of State Legislatures found that the higher speeds at these low traffic volumes led to a sharp increase in crash rates and a higher rate of fatalities. It was also at about three weeks in that Brian Cromar’s team began noticing “upticks in crashes that were completely avoidable due to the speeds.”\nWhile the high speeds brought unexpected danger to largely empty roads, the relationship between low volumes and dangerous speeds has been consistent in the months following the lock down as different pandemic related restrictions began to ease. Because of that, the volumes on highways are once again on the rise, bringing crash statistics to more familiar levels as well. The recovery rate has not been very fast but by May of 2020, the volumes had already returned to 30% of what they had been pre-pandemic. Of course, speeding remains a very real issue, but it is only as much as it had been before COVID-19 struck."

    "text": "Construction Challenges and Opportunities\nDangerous speeds were not the only unexpected change the pandemic brought to everyday highway operations. Because Brian Cromar oversees material testing across highway improvement project timelines, he became very familiar with both the opportunities and pitfalls the pandemic presented to the highway improvement programs. Because of decreased volumes, he reported that some construction projects progressed much faster than was typical. Customarily, construction on highways in the region of Colorado in which he operates must take place in the middle of the night, when there are the fewest cars on the road and needed lane closures are safest. However, with the advent of the pandemic, construction contractors were able to safely close down more of the highway at a time and accelerate construction on select highway improvement projects. Cromar cited one project that had been completed in a fraction of the expected timeline due to the ability to close an entire intersection without creating unsafe traffic congestion. The reconstruction was completed in a matter of weeks, whereas the original plan would have taken several months to safely close and reroute traffic section by section.\nWhile these accelerated projects presented positive effects of the pandemic, they were the exception rather than the norm. Larger projects saw significant delays due to the local and global supply chain failures characteristic of 2020, Cromar reported. The expense of these delays were borne by the state rather than the contractors, who were not at fault. While many projects nationwide saw delays, many more were cancelled altogether. A large share of projects in nearly every state were defunded in a push to comply with COVID protocols (Table 1, Source: ARTBA). The American Road and Transportation Builders Association specifies that an estimated $9.6 billion in transportation projects have been delayed or canceled entirely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and economic downturn. $132.8 billion of funding initiatives have failed, and $33.2 billion have been lost due to diverted funding or budget cuts as a result of the pandemic. (See Table 1)\n\ntibble('Type of Delay' = c(\"Projects delayed or canceled\", \"Funding initiative delayed, canceled, or vetoed\", \"Revenue declines, budget cuts, and diverted funds\"),\n       \"Total Value\" = c(\"$9.6 Billion\", \"$132.8 Billion\", \"$33.26 Billion\")) %&gt;%\n  kableExtra::kbl() %&gt;%\n  kableExtra::kable_styling()\n\n\n\nTable 1: Covid-19 Project Costs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType of Delay\nTotal Value\n\n\n\n\nProjects delayed or canceled\n$9.6 Billion\n\n\nFunding initiative delayed, canceled, or vetoed\n$132.8 Billion\n\n\nRevenue declines, budget cuts, and diverted funds\n$33.26 Billion"

    "section": "Financial Shortcomings",
    "text": "Financial Shortcomings\nIn the economic downturn we see now, state and local governments still appear hesitant to impose new taxes to fund these projects. Public funds have been directed instead towards saving small businesses, reducing substantial pandemic-related deficits, and other programs intended to help their constituents in more immediate ways. Many state and local governments see infrastructure projects as non-essential or not pressing, and therefore we have seen a trend of prioritizing immediate economic relief. With all these reductions in financial support for infrastructure projects in recent months, construction jobs are also on the decline. ARTBA estimates that up to 2.3 million jobs could be lost, which would only contribute to the downturn of United States Highway quality.\nFor Brian Cromar, failures in transportation funding have thrown off several projects across the State of Colorado. For example, due to the shifting nature of the pandemic, Cromar saw a contractor walk away from a contract in the middle of a project because of internal financial difficulties. Another kind of stress came when a project to reconstruct one side of a major stretch of highway was expanded to repair, but not replace, the opposite side as well. This may seem like an upgrade, but the alteration was due to a dismal calculation that the funds required to complete, meaning the full project could not be secured for another 35-40 years.\nUnfortunately, shortages in financial support for United States highway systems are not unique to the pandemic era. Funding for these necessary improvement projects typically stem from three sources: fuel tax, sales tax, and tolls. With the decreased traffic volumes mentioned earlier, all three of sources saw significant declines against the backdrop of a system already overdue for reform. For the past 5 years, the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act has provided financial stability and security for the 50 Departments of Transportations around the country, providing much of the financial support necessary to maintain and replenish America’s highway networks. The FAST Act will expire in October of 2021, after receiving a one-year extension by congress in response to the pandemic, at which point the policies and allocation of highway improvement funds will once again come under legislative review.\nIn fact, the extension of the FAST Act was in response to an urgent plea for aid. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Organizations (AASHTO) – the organization that represents all 50 Departments of Transportation – sent a report to the United States Congress early April of 2020 detailing America’s urgent infrastructure situation in light of the ongoing pandemic. In their report, AASHTO estimated 30% in state transportation revenues would be lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic and throughout the next 18 months. Because of the loss of these funds and the expiring FAST Act, AASHTO urged congress to address infrastructure issues in their next Coronavirus Relief Bill. Their response, as mentioned previously was to extend the FAST Act by a year and include additional funds in several of their relief measures. But much like the extended highway reconstruction project Cromar oversaw, Congress’s action has patched up, but not replaced a system that will need reconstruction soon."

    "text": "Looking Forward\nFortunately, as the United States approaches the tail end of this pandemic, the future of infrastructure may not be as bleak as it appears. On March 31, 2021, the Biden administration released a massive infrastructure improvement proposal; the very first point on the fact sheet released by the White House reads, “President Biden’s plan will: Fix highways, rebuild bridges, upgrade ports, airports and transit systems.” The plan invests millions in repairing 20,000 miles of highways and other main roads, in turn creating countless “good-paying, union jobs.” The funds included in this proposal would not be drawn from gas tax and sales tax, but from an increase in corporate taxes. Should this plan receive the support of Congress and be implemented, many of the losses projected by ARTBA from the COVID-19 pandemic would be eased and averted, minimalizing the long-term effects the pandemic has had on the progress of highway transportation.\nAs the nation continues to recover and move towards more familiar patterns, some trends - and deficits - have become more obvious than ever before. From the impact of empty roads on fatal crash rates, to the spasmodic disruptions of highway construction, to the precarious financial mechanisms behind the great American highway system, the COVID-19 Pandemic brought with it serious consequences and valuable lessons. What the nation does with these new insights and exposed weaknesses will determine the future of our highway infrastructure."

It would be good to ensure that we get an itemized detail of everything they are covering, because there were a few places where we believed admissions were covered by Melissa and they were not. It is also good to independently check whether the hotels have breakfast; we were informed that the hotel in Singapore would provide breakfast, but they didn’t even have it available.\nWe should probably do a better job of communicating with the tour organizer about our expectations for guides and group lunches. We are, after all, not like the typical retirees or holiday tourists they are used to. Our best guides — Nee in Bangkok and Sum in Siem Reap — understood that we were up for something a little different, more self-guided and exploratory. We also probably don’t want to roll up to a restaurant very often, unless it is a group meal that we have explicitly planned on. Food courts are more our style, I think.\nRemind students that American Express and Discover have much smaller international networks, and that a Visa or MasterCard is the only reliable credit card.

Future Transportation 2022, 2, 659-674. https://doi.org/10.3390/futuretransp2030036\n\n\nAutomated traffic signal performance measures (ATSPMs) are used to collect data concerning the current and historical performance of signalized intersections. However, transportation agencies are not using ATSPM data to the full extent of this “big data” resource, because the volume of information can overwhelm traditional identification and prioritization techniques. This paper presents a method that summarizes multiple dimensions of intersection- and corridor-level performance using ATSPM data and returns information that can be used for prioritization of intersections and corridors for further analysis. The method was developed and applied to analyze three signalized corridors in Utah, consisting of 20 total intersections. Four performance measures were used to develop threshold values for evaluation: platoon ratio, split failures, arrivals on green, and red-light violations. The performance measures were scaled and classified using \\(k\\)-means cluster analysis and expert input. The results of this analysis produced a score for each intersection and corridor determined from the average of the four measures, weighted by expert input. The methodology is presented as a prototype that can be developed with more performance measures and more extensive corridors for future studies.\n\nPhoto by Alex Eckermann on Unsplash"

Naïve estimates of MWTP, however, may be biased as a result of spatial dependence, spatial correlation, and/or spatially endogenous variables. In this paper we discuss a class of spatial autoregressive models that control for these spatial effects, and apply them to sample data collected for the Atlanta, Georgia housing market. We provide evidence that a general-to-specific model selection methodology that relies on the generality of the spatial Durbin model (SDM) should be preferred to the classical specific-to-general methodology that begins with an assumption of no spatial effects. We show that applying the SDM raises the estimate of MWTP for transit proximity in Atlanta but also widens its confidence interval, relative to ordinary linear regression. This finding may have implications for risk estimations in land value capture forecasts and transportation policy decisions.\n\nPhoto by zekkotek on Unsplash"

Predicting Directional Traffic Volume at Intersections with Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures Data Using Machine Learning Algorithms. Transportation Research Record. https://doi.org/10.1177/03611981241252829\n\n\n\nAutomated traffic signal performance measures (ATSPM) have become widely adopted and utilized by state and local agencies in the U.S. for collecting real-time traffic data 24 h a day, 7 days a week. These agencies have developed new performance measures and applications to address their local transportation planning needs. However, recent research has identified data quality issues in the collected data from ATSPM systems. Specifically, the traffic volumes collected through ATSPM exhibit data anomalies that do not accurately reflect the actual traffic patterns at intersections. As such, there is a need to address the data quality issues found in ATSPM datasets. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the use of machine learning algorithms and statistical methods to predict traffic volume at intersections. Existing traffic volume data, along with additional metrics such as timestamps, weather conditions, crash data, and holidays, are evaluated to predict traffic volume and address the data anomalies present in ATSPM datasets. Two statistical methods and four machine learning algorithms are evaluated to determine their ability to predict traffic volumes. By comparing the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between each model, the results demonstrate that the long short-term memory (LSTM) model exhibits the lowest error in predicting traffic volume compared with the other models. The LSTM model achieves an RMSE as low as 9.4 vehicles and an MAPE as low as 35%. By leveraging the LSTM model, traffic agencies can enhance the quality of their ATSPM data, enabling better decision-making for traffic operations by their engineers and planners.\n\nPhoto by James Day on Unsplash"

A Methodology to Detect Traffic Data Anomalies in Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures. Future Transportation, 3(4), 1175–1194. https://doi.org/10.3390/futuretransp3040064\n\n\nAutomated traffic signal performance measures (ATSPMs) have garnered significant attention for their ability to collect and evaluate real-time and historical data at signalized intersections. ATSPM data are widely utilized by traffic engineers, planners, and researchers in various application scenarios. In working with ATSPM data in Utah, it was discovered that five types of ATSPM data anomalies (data switching, data shifting, data missing under 6 months, data missing over 6 months, and irregular curves) were present in the data. To address the data issues, this paper presents a method that enables transportation agencies to automatically detect data anomalies in their ATSPM datasets. The proposed method utilizes the moving average and standard deviation of a moving window to calculate the z-score for traffic volume data points at each timestamp. Anomalies are flagged when the z-score exceeds 2, which is based on the data falling within two standard deviations of the mean. The results demonstrate that this method effectively identifies anomalies within ATSPM systems, thereby enhancing the usability of data for engineers, planners, and all ATSPM users. By employing this method, transportation agencies can improve the efficiency of their ATSPM systems, leading to more accurate and reliable data for analysis.\n\nPhoto by Moritz Kindler on Unsplash"

Existing research, however, has been based on microscopic simulation or relied on extensive calibration of Kalman filter and related models to produce reliable queue length estimates. This research seeks to develop methodologies for improving and simplifying the calibration process of existing queue length models by applying loop detector data including volume, occupancy, and the metering rate data for ramp meters along I-15 in Utah. A conservation model and several variations of a Kalman filter model generated estimated queues that were compared to observed queue lengths in 60 s bins. A modified Kalman filter model and a new heuristic model derived from cluster analysis—the models that yielded the best results—provided queue length estimates that were generally within approximately eight vehicles of the observed queue length. Using the ramp metering rate, the queue length estimates were converted into wait times that were generally within approximately 30 s of the actual wait time, producing a viable method to predict wait time from up-to-the-minute traffic detection information with relatively little required calibration. The implementation of the ramp meter queue length and wait time estimation algorithms presented in this research will allow departments of transportation to better assess freeway and ramp conditions, which can then aid in reducing congestion throughout the freeway network.\n\nPhoto by Denys Novozhai on Unsplash"

The influence of past exposure to the built environment on current vehicle ownership decisions may be causal, but there are alternative explanations. Households may primarily select to live in neighborhoods that facilitate their vehicle ownership preferences, or they may retain preferences that they have developed in the past, irrespective of their current situations. This study seeks to control for these alternative explanations by including the built environment attributes of households’ past residences as an influence on vehicle ownership choices. We use a dataset from a credit reporting firm that contains up to nine previous residential ZIP codes for households currently living in the 13-county Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area. Results show that past location is significant, but of marginal influence relative to the attributes of the current location. From a practical perspective, our results suggest that models that include current but not past neighborhood attributes (also controlling for standard socioeconomic variables) can forecast vehicle ownership decisions reasonably well. However, models that include both current and past neighborhood attributes can provide a more nuanced understanding of the built environment’s potentially causal influences on vehicle ownership decisions. This better understanding may provide more realistic forecasts of responses to densification or other travel demand management strategies.\n\nPhoto by Jonas Jaeken on Unsplash"

No standard, agreed-upon method exists for this purpose. If alternative methods produce reasonably consistent results, then an analyst may select a method based on convenience. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this is the case. We reviewed existing applications and methods for estimating site-generated VMT, which can be conceptualized as the product of site-level trip generation and average length of a site-generated trip. We identified four plausible methods for estimating site-level trip generation and three for estimating average lengths of site-generated trips. Combining these yielded 12 methods for estimating site-generated VMT. We applied these methods to estimate trip generation, average trip length, and total VMT generated by eight existing office sites in the San Francisco Bay Area (CA) and the Wasatch Front Region of Utah. We found that trip generation and trip length estimates varied widely, with greater variation in trip generation estimates than in trip length estimates. Variation was magnified when the estimates were multiplied to produce site-generated VMT estimates, with the minimum estimate at a single site ranging from 84% to 96% lower than the corresponding maximum."

Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 53, 59–75. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2015.01.021\n\n\nIn the past few years, numerous mobile applications have made it possible for public transit passengers to find routes and/or learn about the expected arrival time of their transit vehicles. Though these services are widely used, their impact on overall transit ridership remains unclear. The objective of this research is to assess the effect of real-time information provided via web-enabled and mobile devices on public transit ridership. An empirical evaluation is conducted for New York City, which is the setting of a natural experiment in which a real-time bus tracking system was gradually launched on a borough-by-borough basis beginning in 2011. Panel regression techniques are used to evaluate bus ridership over a three year period, while controlling for changes in transit service, fares, local socioeconomic conditions, weather, and other factors. A fixed effects model of average weekday unlinked bus trips per month reveals an increase of approximately 118 trips per route per weekday (median increase of 1.7% of weekday route-level ridership) attributable to providing real-time information. Further refinement of the fixed effects model suggests that this ridership increase may only be occurring on larger routes; specifically, the largest quartile of routes defined by revenue miles of service realized approximately 340 additional trips per route per weekday (median increase of 2.3% per route). Although the increase in weekday route-level ridership may appear modest, on aggregate these increases exert a substantial positive effect on farebox revenue. The implications of this research are critical to decision-makers at the country’s transit operators who face pressure to increase ridership under limited budgets, particularly as they seek to prioritize investments in infrastructure, service offerings, and new technologies.\n\nPhoto by Andra C Taylor Jr on Unsplash"

Travel time buffers require researchers to assert mode of access as well as an arbitrary distance threshold; further, these methods do not distinguish between destination quality attributes in an effective way. In this research, we present a methodology to develop utility-based accessibility measures for parks, libraries, and grocery stores in Utah County, Utah. The method relies on passive location-based services data to model destination choice to these community resources; the destination choice model utility functions in turn allow us to develop a picture of regional access that is sensitive to: the quality and size of the destination resource; continuous (non-binary) travel impedance by multiple modes; and the sociodemographic attributes of the traveler. We then use this measure to explore equity in access to the specified community resources across income level in Utah County: the results reveal a discrepancy between which neighborhoods might be targeted for intervention using space-based analysis.\n\nPhoto by nrd on Unsplash"
