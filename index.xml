      <title>Can Utah County Choose to Grow Sustainably?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week the Deseret News ran a contributed
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2020/8/10/21358753/guest-opinion-utah-county-tech-centric-future-human-natural-resources-silicon-slopes-farming-desert&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;opinion piece by Andrew Skabelund&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:Who-was-a-friend&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:Who-was-a-friend&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
in which he argued that the rapid development of Silicon Slopes in north Utah
County comes at the cost of Utah County&amp;rsquo;s value as agricultural land. He cites
an interesting fact (originally credited to Jared Farmer) I had not known previously:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Native Americans living in Utah Valley did not see the mountains as the
primary feature of the landscape; instead, their perspective was dominated by
Utah Lake and the Provo River, which &amp;mdash; though hard to believe now &amp;mdash; were
abundant sources of food. In fact, it was fishing expeditions to Utah Valley
that kept the first pioneers alive in the Salt Lake Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Utah Lake lost its vibrant productivity, due in large measure to
overfishing, industrial pollution and watershed disruption from irrigation and
overgrazing, it also lost its cultural significance. Mount Timpanogos became
the dominant cultural landmark for most Utah residents, and if you’ve grown up
here, it’s a bit shocking to learn that our lake was anything but some smelly,
murky carp aquarium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with Skabelund that Utah County&amp;rsquo;s growth has come at great cost to the
natural environment, and that this growth has not necessarily come with an
increased standard of living for the Valley&amp;rsquo;s residents. I too miss the orchards
that have been paved over with soulless strip malls, and wish the Provo River
could sustain robust wild trout populations into Utah Lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I disagree with Skabelund, however, is believing that the choice between
preservation and growth is an either-or proposition. What is required is not to
curtail growth, but rather to grow &lt;em&gt;sustainably&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many residents of Utah County understand values of prudent planning, and of
making choices today that will result in blessings tomorrow. It is sad therefore
that city councils and planning commissions throughout the valley appear to
eagerly accept whatever developers wish to build, with little forethought to how
these developments will impact future growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interchange of SR-92 with I-15 in Lehi was in the middle of a years-long
construction project when I moved away from Utah in 2010. When I moved back in
2019, it was again in the middle of a years long construction project.
One might reasonably ask why UDOT cannot plan more than ten years in advance when
its civil infrastructure is designed to last for 50 or 75 years.  The true
answer is that Silicon Slopes was not in the plan. Maybe it should have been,
or maybe planning officials should have considered how the placement and
design of these office facilities would affect traffic and air quality before
blindly approving whatever was set in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A freeway lane operating at full capacity can carry roughly 2,000 vehicles per
hour. FrontRunner operating at its full design capacity&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:150-passengers-p&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:150-passengers-p&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; could carry 6,000 people per hour.
Utah County planners need to stop seeing FrontRunner as a novelty that moves
a few people who don&amp;rsquo;t want to drive and instead see it as the &lt;em&gt;centerpiece&lt;/em&gt; of
the county&amp;rsquo;s transportation infrastructure. There is a FrontRunner Station at
the heart of Silicon Slopes! The nearest things to it are a golf course and 22
acres of parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current development practices in Utah County are a smorgasbord of missed and
incomplete opportunities like this. UVX is a fabulous project that has earned
national attention for its runaway success; this success is in spite of a major
automobile dealership being the nearest business to fully three of the system&amp;rsquo;s
eighteen stops. Home developers in Pleasant Grove and Springville have been
building attractive and popular semi-detached or fully detached homes on
small-footprint lots; neighborhoods like this make it easier for residents to
walk to schools, shops, or transit and also conserve water by eliminating useless
lawn space. But these particular neighborhoods are hemmed into former industrial
or agricultural lots without access to any of these additional community
resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2050, more people are projected to live in Utah County than in Salt Lake
County. Continuing to build large single-family homes, strip malls, freeway lanes,
and office parks dominated by parking will destroy what is left of our water and
air quality. But there things each city should do to grow sustainably:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a master transportation plan that prioritizes active transportation
and public transit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Require that new  developments contribute to this plan in their designs.
This often means placing parking behind developments so that cyclists and
pedestrians do not have to cross acres of parking lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build housing for families of all sizes, structures, and incomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement tax incentives that promote higher density developments around
transit stations and in the city core. A
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.strongtowns.org/landvaluetax&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;land value tax&lt;/a&gt; would use the
power of the market to accomplish these objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oregonmetro.gov/urban-growth-boundary&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;urban growth boundary&lt;/a&gt;
to change the economic incentives that favor unsustainable sprawl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot in fact eat silicon. We might be able to have our silicon and still
eat our apricots long into the future if we can make it a priority to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across this graphic from an
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apta.com/wp-content/uploads/Resources/resources/statistics/Documents/FactBook/APTA_2011_Fact_Book.pdf&#34;&gt;APTA Factbook&lt;/a&gt;(p. 20)
which shows transit with an enormous safety advantage over automobiles. I was
curious if I could update the data using information from the Bureau of Transportation
Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;knitr::include_graphics(&amp;quot;https://i.imgur.com/7txj1aA.png&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/7txj1aA.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;passenger-miles&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Passenger Miles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we want to get passenger miles traveled by different modes. The BTS
has this data in an Excel spreadsheet at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bts.gov/content/us-passenger-miles&#34;&gt;https://www.bts.gov/content/us-passenger-miles&lt;/a&gt;.
The data in the spreadsheet is somewhat spotty, and there are &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; of footnotes
describing the fact that the sources of the different elements have
changed over the years. But let’s go with just data from 2000 onward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to read the Excel files directly from the BTS website, but there was
just too much cleaning that needed to be done to make them machine-readable in a
nice way. You can find the lightly modified spreadsheet I used, including a
separate analysis from this one, &lt;a href=&#34;/files/passmiles.xlsx&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# get Excel file from BTS
passmiles &amp;lt;- read_excel(here(&amp;quot;content/post/safety/passmiles.xlsx&amp;quot;), 
                        skip = 1, sheet = &amp;quot;passenger_miles&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  filter(!is.na(Mode)) %&amp;gt;%
  select(Group, Mode, `2000`:`2018`) %&amp;gt;%
  pivot_longer(cols = `2000`:`2018`, names_to = &amp;quot;year&amp;quot;, values_to = &amp;quot;passmiles&amp;quot;, 
               names_transform = list(year = as.integer)) %&amp;gt;%
  # convert from million miles to miles
  mutate( passmiles = passmiles * 1e6 ) %&amp;gt;%
  distinct() &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers in the data table are given in Millions. To keep our units
straight, we are going to use straight miles for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(passmiles, aes(x = year, y = passmiles, label = Mode, color = Mode, 
                      group = str_c(Group, Mode))) +
  geom_path() + facet_wrap(~Group, scales = &amp;quot;free_y&amp;quot;) + 
  geom_dl(method = list(dl.trans(x = x + 0.2), &amp;quot;last.points&amp;quot;, cex = 0.6)) +
  geom_dl(method = list(dl.trans(x = x - 0.2), &amp;quot;first.points&amp;quot;, cex = 0.6))  +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1995, 2022)) +
  scale_color_discrete(guide = FALSE) +
  ylab(&amp;quot;Passenger Miles&amp;quot;) + xlab(&amp;quot;Year&amp;quot;) +
  theme_bw()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/safety/2020-06-02-transit-safety_files/figure-html/passmiles-plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;fatalities-by-mode&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fatalities by Mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BTS also publishes statistics on fatality broken up by mode at: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bts.gov/content/transportation-fatalities-modea&#34;&gt;https://www.bts.gov/content/transportation-fatalities-modea&lt;/a&gt;. However, there are a number of potential issues
arising from these data. First, transit fatalities are grouped by workers and
vehicle occupants, but are not separated by mode. Additionally, there are a
number of redundant categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fatalities &amp;lt;- read_excel(here(&amp;quot;content/post/safety/passmiles.xlsx&amp;quot;), 
                        sheet = &amp;quot;fatalities&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  filter(!is.na(Mode)) %&amp;gt;%
  select(Group, Mode, `2000`:`2018`) %&amp;gt;%
  pivot_longer(cols = `2000`:`2018`, names_to = &amp;quot;year&amp;quot;, values_to = &amp;quot;fatalities&amp;quot;, 
               names_transform = list(year = as.integer))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(fatalities %&amp;gt;% filter(Group %in% c(&amp;quot;Air&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Highway&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Rail&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Transit&amp;quot;)),
       aes(x = year, y = fatalities, label = Mode, color = Mode,  
           group = str_c(Group, Mode))) +
  geom_path() + facet_wrap(~Group, scales = &amp;quot;free_y&amp;quot;) + 
  geom_dl(method = list(dl.trans(x = x + 0.2), &amp;quot;last.points&amp;quot;, cex = 0.6)) +
  geom_dl(method = list(dl.trans(x = x - 0.2), &amp;quot;first.points&amp;quot;, cex = 0.6))  +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1995, 2022)) +
  scale_color_discrete(guide = FALSE) +
  ylab(&amp;quot;Fatalities&amp;quot;) + xlab(&amp;quot;Year&amp;quot;) +
  theme_bw()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: Removed 6 row(s) containing missing values (geom_path).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/safety/2020-06-02-transit-safety_files/figure-html/fatalities-plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;fatalities-per-100-million-miles&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fatalities per 100 Million Miles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the two report tables use different modal definitions, we will consider
only group-levels with the following pairs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air: all fatalities and passenger miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highway: all fatalities and passenger miles, minus bus fatalities and miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transit: fatalities and passenger miles by rail and non-rail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rail: Only Intercity rail miles; passenger rail fatalities minus transit rail fatalities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;miles_summary &amp;lt;- passmiles %&amp;gt;% 
  # remove bus miles from highway group
  filter(!(Group == &amp;quot;Highway&amp;quot; &amp;amp; Mode == &amp;quot;Bus&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;%
  # only keep intercity rail
  filter(!(Group == &amp;quot;Rail&amp;quot; %in% c(&amp;quot;Light Rail&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Heavy Rail&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Commuter Rail&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;All&amp;quot;))) %&amp;gt;%
  # remove summary miles from all other groups
  filter(!(Group == &amp;quot;Transit&amp;quot; &amp;amp; Mode == &amp;quot;All&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;%
  filter(!(Group == &amp;quot;Highway&amp;quot; &amp;amp; Mode == &amp;quot;All&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;%
  # simplify transit modes into rail and non-rail
  mutate(
    Mode = case_when(
      Group == &amp;quot;Transit&amp;quot; &amp;amp; Mode %in% c(&amp;quot;Light Rail&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Heavy Rail&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Commuter Rail&amp;quot;) ~ &amp;quot;Rail&amp;quot;,
      Group == &amp;quot;Transit&amp;quot; ~ &amp;quot;Non-Rail&amp;quot;,
      Group == &amp;quot;Highway&amp;quot; ~ &amp;quot;All&amp;quot;,
      Group == &amp;quot;Rail&amp;quot; ~ &amp;quot;All&amp;quot;,
      Group == &amp;quot;Air&amp;quot; ~ &amp;quot;All&amp;quot;,
      TRUE ~ Mode
    )
  ) %&amp;gt;%
  group_by(Group, Mode, year) %&amp;gt;%
  summarise(passmiles = sum(passmiles))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fatalities_summary &amp;lt;- fatalities %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(
    keep = case_when(
      # all air
      Group == &amp;quot;Air&amp;quot; &amp;amp; Mode == &amp;quot;All&amp;quot; ~ T,
      # all highway but bus
      Group == &amp;quot;Highway&amp;quot; &amp;amp; !(Mode %in% c(&amp;quot;All&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Bus&amp;quot;)) ~ T,
      # transit rail  and non-rail
      Group == &amp;quot;Transit&amp;quot; &amp;amp; Mode %in% c(&amp;quot;Non-Rail&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Rail&amp;quot;) ~ T,
      # passenger rail
      Group == &amp;quot;Rail&amp;quot; &amp;amp; Mode == &amp;quot;All&amp;quot; ~ T,
      TRUE ~ F
    ),
    Mode = ifelse(Group == &amp;quot;Highway&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;All&amp;quot;, Mode), 
  ) %&amp;gt;% filter(keep) %&amp;gt;%
  group_by(Group, Mode, year) %&amp;gt;%
  summarise(fatalities = sum(fatalities))
  
# remove transit rail fatalities from rail 
transit_rail_fatalities &amp;lt;- fatalities_summary %&amp;gt;% filter(Mode == &amp;quot;Rail&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% pull(fatalities)
  
fatalities_summary &amp;lt;- fatalities_summary %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(
    transit_rail_fatalities = transit_rail_fatalities,
    fatalities = ifelse(Group == &amp;quot;Rail&amp;quot;, fatalities - transit_rail_fatalities, fatalities)
  )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can join the two datasets together, and compute the fatalities per
100 million miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fatal_rate &amp;lt;- left_join(miles_summary, fatalities_summary, 
                        by = c(&amp;quot;Group&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Mode&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;year&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(
    fatal_rate = fatalities / (passmiles / 1e8) # fatalities per 100 million miles
  )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(fatal_rate, aes(
  x = year, y = fatal_rate, 
  color = str_c(Group, Mode, sep = &amp;quot; &amp;quot;), 
  label = str_c(Group, Mode, sep = &amp;quot; &amp;quot;), 
  )) +
  geom_path() +
  geom_dl(method = list(dl.trans(x = x + 0.2), &amp;quot;last.points&amp;quot;, cex = 0.6)) +
  geom_dl(method = list(dl.trans(x = x - 0.2), &amp;quot;first.points&amp;quot;, cex = 0.6))  +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1999, 2019)) +
  scale_color_discrete(guide = FALSE) +
  ylab(&amp;quot;Fatalities per 100 Million Passenger Miles&amp;quot;) + 
  xlab(&amp;quot;Year&amp;quot;) + 
  theme_bw()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/safety/2020-06-02-transit-safety_files/figure-html/fatal-rate-plot-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my understanding, if a light rail train hits a pedestrian, it counts as a
highway fatality &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a transit fatality. Given that a large number of the
rail fatalities are due to trespassers and at-grade crossings, this may overstate
the safety to rail &lt;em&gt;passengers&lt;/em&gt;. Also, it double-counts fatalities resulting from
a commuter rail train colliding with a private automobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thoughs on the APTA chart:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe they used Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) instead of passenger miles traveled.
Because the average occupancy of a vehicle is somewhat over 1.0, this overstates
the relative danger of highway modes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe they considered only fatalities among &lt;em&gt;transit passengers&lt;/em&gt; resulting
from &lt;em&gt;train crashes&lt;/em&gt;, and did not include fatalities among transit workers or
other users killed by trains. I believe they did, however, include all highway
fatalities, and not simply vehicle occupants. You could make the argument that
this is the correct comparison, but I don’t believe that it is fair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>The Urban Church</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Last night I read the surprising announcement that the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints is financing the development and construction of a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20140213_Mormons_to_build_32-story_tower_in_Center_City.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;32 floor
residential and commercial building in the heart of downtown
Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;.
The Church has owned this property for a while, and has
already begun construction on the adjacent Philadelphia Temple, to be opened in
2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Church is no stranger to urban development. A central doctrine of early
Mormonism was the idea of Zion, a city where the faithful would gather to
prepare the world for the return of Christ. Joseph Smith and Brigham Young each
built their own cities, in Nauvoo (Illinois) and Salt Lake City, according to
ideals of community participation and ideal civic life. As Mormons colonized the
intermountain west, they invariably placed at the center of their cities a
temple or chapel of some sort (see: Provo, Ogden, Logan, Saint George). In the
past decade, the Church has constructed a string of urban meetinghouses or
temples in places such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://lagallc.com/projects/wan-chai.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lds.org/church/temples/manhattan-new-york?lang=eng&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;. The
Church also has a great deal of experience with urban commercial land
development, having completed the City Creek project in downtown Salt Lake City
early last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would any church invest in commercial properties at all? Surely some would
say (and have said) the money would be better spent on church operations, or on
humanitarian and welfare missions. When City Creek was announced, Church&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/city-creek-center-an-economic-revitalization&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gordon B. Hinckley
said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renewed vitality at the head of Main Street will result in increased vitality
throughout the entire city. We of the Church have wanted to keep our city
youthful and attractive. People come here to Temple Square from all over the
world in ever-increasing numbers, and it is important that we keep the Square
and its environs beautiful and inviting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that this is some of the rationale behind the Philadelphia investment.
I&amp;rsquo;ve never spent time in Philadelphia, but my friend (and Penn alum) James Wong
confirmed &amp;ldquo;that part of Philly has been in need of some love.&amp;rdquo; Perhaps the
Church is hoping to ensure that the temple is in the best neighborhood possible,
and is willing to make that neighborhood itself if it must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is true, why is Philadelphia the first city (outside Utah) to get this
treatment? Are other temples not in need of similar protection? I&amp;rsquo;ve
noticed several periods and styles of temple placement (without clearly defined
beginnings or ends and with plenty of exceptions):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1836-1900: temples are planned to be the centerpieces of new Mormon communities (Nauvoo, Salt Lake,
Logan, Saint George)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1900-1995: temples are built in suburbs of cities where there are strong Mormon congregations (Sandy Springs (Atlanta GA), Silver
Spring (DC,MD), Glenview (Chicago IL))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1995-present: smaller temples are built in suburban areas where there are active congregations &amp;ldquo;far&amp;rdquo; from an
existing temple (such as the temples &amp;ldquo;in&amp;rdquo; Louisville, Nashville, Raleigh,
Columbia, Birmingham, and Orlando).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philadelphia will join Salt Lake City, Hong Kong, Copenhagen, and New York in
the elite club of cities with decidedly urban temples (perhaps the new Provo
City Center Temple should count?). But Salt Lake fits clearly in Phase 1, and
the other three (4?) are all outliers built for special congregations. Does the
Philadelphia Temple represent a new phase for the Church? Here&amp;rsquo;s a thought
exercise: if Philadelphia had gotten its temple in 1996, would it not go in
Norristown? Or if London were getting a temple today (instead of 1958), &lt;a
href=&#34;https://www.google.com/maps/place/W+Park+Rd/@51.411414,-0.0810593,10z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4875f73db1904e09:0x1c21fa6de21b3de&#34;&gt;who
would ever put it in Newchapel&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-suburban-religion&#34;&gt;A suburban religion?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a
strong trend in wider North American society to reclaim central cities and make
them pleasant places for people to live, work, and socialize. Millenials are
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/03/why-dont-young-americans-buy-cars/255001/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;buying cars at much lower
rates&lt;/a&gt;
than our parents&amp;rsquo; generations, and are much more
likely to live in urban areas. With college-aged and young professional people
far more likely to join the Church than older, more set individuals, it seems
obvious that the official &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PF0h7oqUEQ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a
Mormon&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; advertising
campaign should be aimed primarily at these young urbanites. But if the nearest
Church building requires a half-hour drive out of the city, a young investigator
who gets around on her bike is going to find showing up on Sunday difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a conversation with a college classmate about a month ago, where he
expressed his reluctance to apply for a job in the Salt Lake valley, citing the
&amp;ldquo;way politics in Salt Lake is going.&amp;rdquo; It was clear he didn&amp;rsquo;t like that Salt Lake
has a democratic mayor and a liberal city council. I think the recent (albeit
temporary) legalization of gay marriage in Utah also frightened him. Cities
generally are overwhelmingly progressive, and in suburban-oriented thought can
appear as harbors of sin and villainy. And short of iniquity, the benefits
sometimes attributed to urban life &amp;mdash; sustainability, a wider range of dining
options, a vehicle-free lifestyle &amp;mdash; may not be valued by traditional suburban
Mormons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are we, as Mormons, to make of the Church&amp;rsquo;s investments in central
cities? Surely the Church is not frightened of Salt Lake City, and is going to
great expense to make the city &amp;ldquo;youthful and attractive.&amp;rdquo; The investment in
Philadelphia shows that the Church is reaching out to other areas as well.
Perhaps the Latter-day Saints should take note.&lt;/p&gt;
