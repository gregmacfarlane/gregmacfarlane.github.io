I am an assistant professor of Civil Engineering at BYU. I am interested in
transportation forecasting models, including activity-based models of travel 
behavior and applications of emerging datasets and spatial econometrics. I
am particularly interested in improving the methods of modeling and how the tools of transport modeling might also be applied in other fields.

I teach courses on sustainability, transportation engineering, transport modeling,
and traffic simulation.
