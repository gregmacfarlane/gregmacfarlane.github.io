Automated traffic signal performance measures (ATSPMs) have garnered significant
attention for their ability to collect and evaluate real-time and historical
data at signalized intersections. ATSPM data are widely utilized by traffic
engineers, planners, and researchers in various application scenarios. In
working with ATSPM data in Utah, it was discovered that five types of ATSPM data
anomalies (data switching, data shifting, data missing under 6 months, data
missing over 6 months, and irregular curves) were present in the data. To
address the data issues, this paper presents a method that enables
transportation agencies to automatically detect data anomalies in their ATSPM
datasets. The proposed method utilizes the moving average and standard deviation
of a moving window to calculate the z-score for traffic volume data points at
each timestamp. Anomalies are flagged when the z-score exceeds 2, which is based
on the data falling within two standard deviations of the mean. The results
demonstrate that this method effectively identifies anomalies within ATSPM
systems, thereby enhancing the usability of data for engineers, planners, and
all ATSPM users. By employing this method, transportation agencies can improve
the efficiency of their ATSPM systems, leading to more accurate and reliable
data for analysis.
